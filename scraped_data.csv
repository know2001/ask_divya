Working in the United States,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states,"
Many noncitizens want to come to the United States to work. This page provides a summary of employment-based nonimmigrant and immigrant visa classifications and other categories of noncitizens who are eligible for employment authorization. Each classification provides a link to more detailed information on its requirements.
A common way to work temporarily in the United States as a nonimmigrant is for a prospective employer to file a petition with USCIS on your behalf. The Temporary (Nonimmigrant) Workers webpage describes the main nonimmigrant temporary worker classifications.
If you have the right combination of skills, education, and/or work experience, you may be able to live and work permanently in the United States by seeking an employment-based immigrant visa. The Permanent Workers webpage describes the five employment-based immigrant visa preferences (also called categories).
If you live outside the United States and want to work here, you generally must apply for a visa from the U.S. Department of State (DOS), unless a visa is not required for people from your country of nationality. You may visit DOS’ Travel Without a Visa page for more information.
In many cases, USCIS must approve your petition before you are eligible to apply to DOS for a visa or seek admission at a port of entry. Before entering the United States, you must present yourself to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer and receive permission to enter the United States and engage in your proposed activity.
If you are in the United States in a lawful nonimmigrant status that does not provide employment authorization, you generally may apply for:
A change of status to a nonimmigrant classification that provides employment authorization; or
An adjustment of status to become a lawful permanent resident. This may be a concurrent filing with an immigrant visa petition or, depending on the circumstances, may require an applicant to obtain an approved immigrant visa before applying for an adjustment of status to become a lawful permanent resident.

Depending on the classification you seek, your change or adjustment of status application might require a U.S. employer or other qualified requestor to file an application or petition on your behalf to establish your eligibility before we approve your application. However, if you apply based on certain classifications (for example, an alien with extraordinary ability or as a nonimmigrant E-1 or E-2 principal treaty trader or investor), you may be eligible to self-petition, which means filing an application on your own behalf.
Additionally, if you are in the United States, including if you are an applicant for permanent residence or a certain family member of an alien who has lawful nonimmigrant status, you may file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, to request employment authorization and an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). You may also apply for an EAD that shows such authorization if your immigration status authorizes you to work in the United States without restrictions.
The conditions you must meet and how long you can work in the United States depend on the type of immigration status the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grants. You must comply with all conditions of your employment authorization and the terms of your admission to this country. If you violate any of the conditions, you could be removed from or denied re-entry into the United States."

Options for Nonimmigrant Workers Following Termination of Employment,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/information-for-employers-and-employees/options-for-nonimmigrant-workers-following-termination-of-employment,"
When nonimmigrant workers are laid off, they may not be aware of their options and may, in some instances, wrongly assume that they have no option but to leave the country within 60 days.
When a nonimmigrant worker’s employment is terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, they typically may take one of the following actions, if eligible, to remain in a period of authorized stay in the United States:
File an application for a change of nonimmigrant status;
File an application for adjustment of status;
File an application for a “compelling circumstances” employment authorization document; or
Be the beneficiary of a nonfrivolous petition to change employer.

If one of these actions occurs within the up to 60-day grace period, the nonimmigrant’s period of authorized stay in the United States can exceed 60 days, even if they lose their previous nonimmigrant status. If the worker takes no action within the grace period, they and their dependents may then need to depart the United States within 60 days, or when their authorized validity period ends, whichever is shorter.
Nonimmigrant status is typically based on an approved Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, or after admission, a subsequently approved Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status. A period of authorized stay typically includes the period when a timely filed nonfrivolous petition or application requesting an extension of stay or change of status is pending with USCIS, as described in detail below.
Maximum 60-Day Grace Period
Regulations permit a discretionary grace period that allows workers in E-1, E-2, E-3, H-1B, H-1B1, L-1, O-1, or TN classifications (and their dependents) to be considered as having maintained status in that same classification after the end of employment for up to 60 consecutive calendar days or until the end of the authorized nonimmigrant validity period, whichever is shorter (the “maximum 60-day grace period”). See 8 CFR 214.1(l)(2).
The worker can preserve their period of authorized stay in the United States, however, as long as the worker timely files, if eligible, an application for a change of nonimmigrant status, an application for adjustment of status, or an application for a compelling circumstances employment authorization document, or if the worker is the beneficiary of a nonfrivolous petition to change employer before their nonimmigrant status expires.
If the worker is an eligible H-1B nonimmigrant and an employer timely files a new nonfrivolous H-1B petition on their behalf, the worker can begin work immediately after USCIS receives the petition and continue to maintain their H-1B status.
Please see the additional sections below for a detailed overview of these options.
Q: Why is the 60-day grace period important?
A. Before a regulatory change in 2016, there was no grace period for a terminated nonimmigrant worker. The maximum 60-day grace period provides time for a nonimmigrant worker to retain their nonimmigrant status. Alternatively, the 60-grace period provides time for the worker to request a change of status, which may allow the worker to continue their job search from within the United States, even if the grace period and the worker’s current nonimmigrant status expire. This is because a worker may remain in an authorized period of stay based on a timely filed nonfrivolous application to change to a new nonimmigrant status.
The grace period also provides time for certain spouses of nonimmigrant workers to continue their own employment if they have an Employment Authorization Document or are employment-authorized incident to status.
Within the grace period, eligible H-1B nonimmigrant workers may also begin employment again as soon as a new employer properly files a new H-1B petition, rather than waiting for the new petition to be approved. A worker filing for employment in another classification must wait to begin employment until the new petition is approved, but given the availability of premium processing, the wait for petition adjudication is often less than 15 days.
Q: When does the 60-day grace period start?
A: The maximum 60-day grace period starts the day after termination of employment, which is typically determined based on the last day for which a salary or wage is paid.
Q: How do I apply for the grace period?
A: USCIS will determine whether the grace period applies to your case during the adjudication of a subsequent extension of stay petition, change of status application, adjustment of status application, or compelling circumstances employment authorization application. Petitioners and applicants should state in a cover letter that they are requesting that USCIS favorably exercise its discretion to grant the up to 60-day grace period.
Q: Does the 60-day grace period apply to me if I voluntarily leave my job?
A: Yes, the up to 60-day grace period may apply to voluntary and involuntary cessation of employment.
Q: How many times can I use the grace period?
A: You are eligible for the maximum 60-day grace period once during each authorized employer petition validity period. For example, if you are terminated from Employer A, USCIS may favorably exercise its discretion to grant the grace period and consider you to have maintained status for up to 60 days. If you have a new employer petition approval with a new validity period with Employer B and are subsequently terminated, you may be eligible for another 60-day maximum grace period during the petition validity period with Employer B.
Q: What is my status during the grace period?
A: When favorably exercising its discretion, USCIS would consider you to be maintaining nonimmigrant status during the maximum 60-day grace period.
Q: Can I work during the grace period?
A: As during any period of authorized stay, employment is prohibited during the up to 60-day grace period unless otherwise authorized. As long as you remain in a period of authorized stay, which can last beyond the grace period, you remain eligible for the same options to obtain work authorization in the United States as you did during the grace period. (For more details, please see the sections below on portability, change of status, adjustment of status, and compelling circumstances Employment Authorization Documents.)
Q: What if my employer rehires me during the grace period?
A: If your petition with that employer remains valid and you are rehired in the same position, you may resume work with no further action. If you are rehired in a new or changed position, your employer may be required to file an amended or new petition to notify USCIS of any material change. If your employer notified USCIS of the termination, thus automatically revoking the petition approval, the employer would need to file a new petition with USCIS.
Q: Can I travel during the grace period?
A: The grace period ends upon any departure from the United States. If you depart the United States during the maximum 60-day grace period, you must seek another immigration status that would permit reentry.
Q. What happens if my employment is terminated while I am outside of the United States?
A: If a nonimmigrant worker is outside the United States and terminated with no notice period, or the notice period ends before the worker is able to return, then the grace period does not apply and the worker must seek another immigration status that would permit reentry. If the worker is able to, and in fact does, return to the United States before the notice period ends (that is, before the effective date of termination), the discretionary grace period may apply.
Q: Is my dependent spouse’s Employment Authorization Document (EAD) valid during the grace period?
A: Yes, if your spouse has an EAD or employment authorization incident to status, this authorization to work will remain valid during the maximum 60-day grace period.
Q: What happens to my post-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) EAD if my employment is terminated?
A: The maximum 60-day grace period only applies to workers in E-1, E-2, E-3, H-1B, H-1B1, L-1, O-1, or TN classifications (and their dependents). During post-completion OPT, F-1 status is dependent upon employment. Students may not accrue an aggregate of more than 90 days of unemployment during any post-completion OPT. Students granted 24-month Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) OPT may not accrue an aggregate of more than 150 days of unemployment during a total OPT period, including any post-completion OPT period and any subsequent 24-month extension period. See 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(E)
Portability of Employer Petitions
There are two kinds of job portability, or “porting,” available based on two different kinds of employer petitions:
Eligible H-1B nonimmigrants may begin working for a new employer as soon as the employer properly files a new H-1B petition (Form I-129) requesting to amend or extend H-1B status with USCIS, without waiting for the petition to be approved. More information about H-1B portability can be found on our H-1B Specialty Occupations page.
A worker with an adjustment of status application (Form I-485) that has been pending for at least 180 days with an underlying valid immigrant visa petition (Form I-140) can transfer the underlying immigrant visa petition to a qualifying new offer of employment in the same or similar occupational classification with the same or a new employer. More information about this kind of porting can be found in the USCIS Policy Manual.

Q: Can I port to a new H-1B employer during the grace period?
A: H-1B portability allows eligible H-1B nonimmigrants to change employers, or “port,” to a new H-1B employer and begin working for the new employer as soon as a nonfrivolous H-1B petition with a request to amend or extend H-1B status is properly filed with USCIS, without waiting for the new petition to be approved. For additional information please see our H-1B Specialty Occupations webpage.
If you are in another status apart from H-1B, or use the grace period to change your status from H-1B to another status, you must wait for the petition with the new employer to be approved before beginning employment under the new status. As described below, however, as long as the petition or application for change of status is non-frivolous and filed before the end of the grace period (or your authorized validity period, whichever is shorter), you may remain in the United States in an authorized period of stay.
Also note that premium processing can considerably reduce the wait time for adjudication of Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker.
Q: If I find a new H-1B employer, can my new employer file the new H-1B petition without a certified Labor Condition Application (LCA)?
A: No, a certified LCA is required initial evidence that must accompany a properly filed H-1B petition. LCAs are generally reviewed and certified by the Department of Labor within seven working days.
Change of Status
The timely filing of a non-frivolous application to change status will “toll,” or stop, the accrual of unlawful presence until the application is adjudicated, as long as the applicant did not work without authorization, either before the application was filed or while it was pending, and the applicant maintained their status prior to the filing of the request for change of status.
For example, if an individual files a non-frivolous application to change status before the end of the applicant’s maximum 60-day grace period, they will not accrue unlawful presence while the application remains pending, even after the maximum 60-day grace period has elapsed (again, as long as they did not work without authorization either before the application was filed or while it was pending). If the application is ultimately approved, then the individual’s status is changed, and the individual is considered to have been in a period of authorized stay for the entire time the application was pending.  If the application is denied, then the individual starts to accrue unlawful presence the day after the denial decision. Please see our Unlawful Presence and Inadmissibility page for more information.
Workers may use the maximum 60-day grace period to apply to change their nonimmigrant status, which, depending on eligibility, may include:
Changing status to become the dependent of a spouse (for example, H-4, L-2). Some individuals in a dependent nonimmigrant status may be eligible for employment authorization incident to status, including spouses of E-1, E-2, E-3, or L-1 nonimmigrants (see the USCIS Policy Manual). In addition, some spouses of H-1B workers may be eligible for employment authorization if certain requirements are met.
Changing status to student status (for example, F-1) or visitor status (B-1 or B-2). Note that, by statute, B-1 and B-2 nonimmigrant visitors are specifically precluded from “performing skilled or unskilled labor” in the United States. Certain F-1 students, by regulation, may engage in limited employment. For more information, please see our Change My Nonimmigrant Status page.
Seeking a new employer-sponsored nonimmigrant status in the same or different status. For example, depending on the specific facts presented, an L-1 worker may be eligible for new employment under the TN, E-3, or H-1B1 classifications. The timely filing of a non-frivolous change of status petition by a prospective employer will prevent the accrual of unlawful presence until the petition is adjudicated (see above), as long as the worker did not engage in employment without authorization either before the petition was filed or while it was pending. Such a filing alone will not, however, confer employment authorization in the new position while the petition is pending, and will not extend employment authorization if the original classification is no longer valid. Some petitions may be eligible for premium processing for an additional fee. Potential pathways for noncitizen STEM professionals can be found on our Options for Noncitizen STEM Professionals to Work in the United States page.

Q: Can my change of status petition or application be expedited?
A: You may request that USCIS expedite the adjudication of your pending Form I-539 application. USCIS will consider all expedite requests on a case-by-case basis and has the discretion to approve an expedite request if one of the prescribed USCIS expedite criteria has been met. USCIS generally does not consider expedite requests for petitions and applications if premium processing service is available (as are all I-129 petitions).
Q: How soon can I start working if I change my status to an employment-authorized dependent status?
A: Employment is authorized incident to status for certain E and L nonimmigrant spouses; those individuals may begin working as soon as the change of status, if granted, takes effect (typically upon approval of the change of status application). Individuals in other dependent statuses, if eligible for employment authorization, will need to apply for employment authorization by filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and may begin working after approval.
Q: Will my pending I-539 change of status application to B-1 or B-2 be prioritized if I find a new employer who files an I-129 petition with a request for premium processing service?
A: If an employer files a Form I-129 petition on your behalf, along with a request for premium processing service, USCIS will generally process the pending I-539 and the I-129 together during the premium processing timeframe and issue concurrent decisions. This means there should be no delay in adjudication of the I-129 because of the pending I-539. No formal request is required for the pending I-539 to be prioritized. If USCIS approves the I-129 petition, including any requested change of status, then you generally will obtain the nonimmigrant status requested on the I-129 petition (not the I-539), and may begin working. You generally would not need to depart the United States to obtain the requested nonimmigrant status in this scenario.
Q: Can I file a change of status to B-1 or B-2 if I have a pending or approved I-140?
A: Yes, having a pending or approved I-140 should have no impact on your change of status request, so long as you maintain an intent to depart after any approved temporary period of stay and continue to maintain a residence abroad that you do not intend to abandon.
Q: Can I look for a new job while in B-1 or B-2 status?
A: Yes, searching for employment and interviewing for a position are permissible B-1 or B-2 activities. By statute, however, you may not engage in employment within the domestic labor market (also known as “local labor for hire”) while in B-1 status or engage in any employment while in B-2 status. Before beginning any new employment, a petition and request for a change of status from B-1 or B-2 to an employment-authorized status must be approved, and the new status must take effect. Alternatively, if the change of status request is denied or the petition for new employment requested consular or port of entry notification, the individual must depart the United States and be admitted in an employment-authorized classification before beginning the new employment.
Q: What happens if my prospective employer’s new petition or my application is denied? Can I file an appeal or a motion?
A: Denial of a request for change of status or extension of stay may not be appealed. However, your employer may appeal a denial of the underlying petition on your behalf (if that case type is within the appellate jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Office. Your employer may also file a motion on a denial of your change or extension request. Both appeals and motions are filed on Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion. Note that the filing of an appeal or motion will not stop the accrual of unlawful presence – it will continue to accrue. If the motion is granted and the underlying application or petition is approved, the change or extension of status may also be approved if otherwise eligible and you will not have accrued unlawful presence.
Adjustment of Status
Some workers may be eligible to file a self-petitioned immigrant visa petition concurrently with an adjustment of status application. Examples of immigrant classifications that are eligible for self-petitioning include EB-1 Extraordinary Ability and EB-5 Immigrant Investor. Workers with a pending adjustment application are generally eligible to remain in the United States in a period of authorized stay and obtain an Employment Authorization Document (EAD).
Compelling Circumstances Employment Authorization Document
Workers who are the beneficiary of an approved employment-based immigrant visa petition (Form I-140) may be eligible for a compelling circumstances Employment Authorization Document (EAD) for up to one year if they:
Do not have an immigrant visa available to them based on the Department of State’s Visa Bulletin; and
Face compelling circumstances.

A compelling circumstances EAD is a discretionary stopgap measure intended to assist certain individuals on the path to lawful permanent resident status by preventing the need to abruptly leave the United States. Workers who begin employment on a compelling circumstances EAD will no longer be maintaining nonimmigrant status but generally will be considered to be in a period of authorized stay, and will not accrue unlawful presence in the United States while the EAD is valid. More information about eligibility requirements and the application process can be found on our Employment Authorization in Compelling Circumstances page.
Q: What is a compelling circumstances EAD?
A: In limited circumstances, USCIS may issue an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) that allows certain noncitizens facing compelling circumstances to work for any U.S. employer. Applying for a compelling circumstances EAD may be an option to remain working in the United States if other options are not available to you. A compelling circumstances EAD may assist certain individuals who already have an approved I-140, and face compelling circumstances, but who are not yet eligible to file an adjustment of status application or apply for an immigrant visa because a visa is not yet available based on their priority date, country of chargeability, and preference category. More information about eligibility requirements and the application process can be found on our Employment Authorization in Compelling Circumstances page.
Q: What is my immigration status and work authorization if I’m within the grace period while a compelling circumstances EAD application is pending?
A: USCIS may consider you to be maintaining nonimmigrant status during the maximum 60-day grace period. If you file a nonfrivolous application for a compelling circumstances EAD during the grace period you will not accrue unlawful presence, even if the application remains pending after the grace period ends. However, you may not work during this period unless otherwise authorized.
Q: What happens if I have a compelling circumstances EAD application approved, but a change of status application is still pending?
A: If the compelling circumstances EAD is approved, you are authorized for employment based on compelling circumstances. If your I-94 has expired, you will not be in a nonimmigrant status, however you will be considered as being in a period of authorized stay during the EAD validity period. If your compelling circumstances EAD application is approved, and you work using the compelling circumstances EAD or are no longer maintaining your nonimmigrant status, you will not be eligible to change your status in the United States.
Q: What will happen if I make an expedite request for my compelling circumstances EAD application?
A: The USCIS Contact Center will create and forward a service request for consideration for expeditious handling on your behalf to the office with jurisdiction over your application. The reviewing office will contact you if additional information is required to process your expedite request. You will receive a notice from USCIS with a decision to either approve or deny your expedite request.
Q: Can I still file an Adjustment of Status application (Form I-485) if I am working based on a compelling circumstances EAD?
A: If you are working in the United States under a compelling circumstances EAD and your immigrant visa priority date becomes current, you generally would not be eligible to file Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence of Adjust Status. Instead, you would need to request USCIS to notify the Department of State’s National Visa Center (NVC) if your immigrant petition is approved so that you may process your immigrant visa application abroad. For more information on immigrant visa processing, please see the NVC Processing web page.
Q: What happens if I am working based on a compelling circumstances EAD and a new employer files an I-129 on my behalf?
A: If you are working in the United States under a compelling circumstances EAD and a new Form I-129 petition is filed on your behalf, you would not be granted a change of status or extension of stay. After the petition is approved for a new work-authorized classification, you would need to apply for a visa and/or admission from outside the United States to begin working.
Q: Are my spouse and children eligible for a compelling circumstances EAD?
A: Yes, your spouse and children may be eligible for a compelling circumstances EAD. They must be in valid nonimmigrant status at the time of filing the compelling circumstances EAD application. Your spouse and children may file their applications concurrently with your application, but their applications cannot be approved until after your application is approved. The validity period of employment authorization granted to your spouse and children may not extend beyond the validity of your employment authorization. 
Expedite Criteria
Some circumstances may warrant expedited adjudication, including applications to change status to a dependent status that includes eligibility for employment authorization. For example, an application to change status from H-1B to L-2 may be eligible for expedited adjudication to prevent severe financial loss. See the How to Make an Expedite Request page for additional information. Please note that USCIS generally does not consider expedite requests for petitions and applications if premium processing service is available.
Departure from the United States
Notwithstanding the above options to extend a period of authorized stay, workers may choose to depart the United States. For H-1B and O workers who chose to depart the United States after involuntary cessation of employment, the H-1B employer or the O employer and O petitioner, as applicable, must pay the reasonable costs of transportation to the worker’s last place of foreign residence. In addition, for O workers, both the employer and the petitioner are jointly and severally liable for the reasonable cost of return transportation. (See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(E) and 8 CFR 214.2(o)(16).)
Once abroad, H-1B holders may seek U.S. employment and readmission to the United States for any remaining period of their H-1B status. Those seeking another classification for which they may be eligible can complete the application or petition process abroad and seek readmission to the United States."
Employment Authorization in Compelling Circumstances,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/information-for-employers-and-employees/employment-authorization-in-compelling-circumstances,"
This temporary employment authorization may be provided to certain nonimmigrants who are the beneficiaries of approved employment-based immigrant visa petitions and their qualifying spouse and children, and who are caught in the continually expanding backlogs for immigrant visas and face compelling circumstances. This stopgap measure is intended to address certain particularly difficult situations, including those that previously may have forced individuals on the path to lawful permanent residence to abruptly stop working and leave the United States. Read our Policy Manual for more detailed information, as well as our resource on Options for Nonimmigrant Workers Following Termination of Employment.
Category (c)(35) is for principal beneficiaries of approved Form I-140s who are in the United States in E-3, H-1B, H-1B1, L-1, or O-1 nonimmigrant status and are applying for an initial grant of employment authorization based on “compelling circumstances,” or a renewal of such authorization.
Category (c)(36) is for qualifying dependent spouses and children of a principal beneficiary granted employment authorization under category (c)(35).

USCIS may grant employment authorization and issue an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) in these two categories for up to one year if we determine that there are compelling circumstances that justify issuing employment authorization.
NOTE: USCIS considers an applicant with a valid EAD based on compelling circumstances to be in a period of authorized stay by the Secretary of Homeland Security. If you receive a compelling circumstances EAD, and begin working based on this EAD, you will be in a period of authorized stay, but you will no longer be maintaining your nonimmigrant status. However, you generally will not accrue unlawful presence in the U.S. while the EAD is valid or, if you filed a non-frivolous application on time, while your application is pending.
Eligibility Requirements
You are eligible to apply for an initial EAD under category (c)(35) if you:
Are in the United States in E-3, H-1B, H-1B1, O-1, or L-1 nonimmigrant status, including in any applicable grace period, on the date you file the application for employment authorization;
Are the principal beneficiary of an approved Form I-140;
Can establish that an immigrant visa is not authorized for issuance to you based on your priority date, preference category, and country of chargeability according to the Final Action Date in effect according to the Department of State’s Visa Bulletin on the date you file your application for employment authorization; and
Can demonstrate that compelling circumstances exist that would justify USCIS using its discretion to issue you an independent grant of employment authorization.

If you want to renew an EAD under category (c)(35), please see the Renewing Your Employment Authorization section below.
Your family members may also apply for employment authorization under category (c)(36). If approved, the validity period for their EADs may not extend beyond the period authorized for you, the principal beneficiary.
How to Apply
You must file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, to request an initial grant of employment authorization under category (c)(35) or (c)(36). You must receive an EAD from USCIS before you can begin working under this employment authorization.

Validity of Employment Authorization
You will not be authorized to work under a compelling circumstances EAD until USCIS approves your Form I-765. If we approve your Form I-765 for an EAD under compelling circumstances, we will grant your employment authorization for one year. You are only authorized to work through the expiration date on your EAD.

Please note that you cannot file the renewal application more than 180 days before your current EAD expires.
Change or Adjustment of Status
If you are working in the United States under a compelling circumstances EAD and your immigrant visa priority date becomes current, you generally would not be eligible to file Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence of Adjust Status. Instead, you would need to request USCIS to notify the Department of State’s National Visa Center (NVC) if your immigrant petition is approved so that you may process your immigrant visa application abroad. For more information on immigrant visa processing, please see the NVC Processing web page.
If you are working in the United States under a compelling circumstances EAD and a new Form I-129 petition is filed on your behalf, you would not be granted a change of status or extension of stay. After the petition is approved for a new work-authorized classification, you would need to apply for a visa and/or admission from outside the United States to begin working.
Avoid Immigration Scams
Some unauthorized practitioners may try to take advantage of you by claiming they can file an EAD application. These same individuals may ask that you pay them to file such forms. To learn the facts about how to protect yourself and your family from scams, please visit uscis.gov/avoidscams."
Validation Instrument for Business Enterprises (VIBE) Program,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/information-for-employers-and-employees/employer-information/validation-instrument-for-business-enterprises-vibe-program,"
The web-based Validation Instrument for Business Enterprises (VIBE) is a tool designed to enhance USCIS’ adjudications of certain employment-based immigration petitions and applications. VIBE uses commercially available data from an independent information provider (IIP) to validate basic information about companies or organizations petitioning to employ certain noncitizens and to validate the basic information about the companies or organizations listed on:
Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker;
Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker;
Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant; and
Form I-485 Supplement J, Confirmation of Bona Fide Job Offer or Request for Job Portability Under INA Section 204(j).

For additional information, please visit the VIBE Questions and Answers page.
Currently, Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) is the independent information provider for the VIBE program.
Background
When adjudicating employment-based petitions or applications, USCIS must primarily rely on paper documentation supplied by the petitioning company or organization to establish the petitioner’s eligibility for the requested classification or by the applicant to confirm a bona fide job offer or request job portability.
When the paperwork does not sufficiently document the evidence required under the law, USCIS must issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) for additional documentation, delaying final adjudication of the petition or application.
The VIBE program has been introduced to address some of these issues.
VIBE Program
VIBE allows USCIS to electronically receive commercially available information from an IIP, currently D&B, about a company or an organization. This information includes:
Business activities, such as type of business (North American Industry Classification System code), trade payment information, and status (active or inactive)
Financial standing, including sales volume and credit standing
Number of employees, both on-site and globally
Relationships with other entities, including foreign affiliates
Type of office (examples include single entities, branches, subsidiaries and headquarters)
Type of legal entity (for example, LLC, partnership or corporation)
Company executives
Date of establishment as a business entity
Current physical address

USCIS officers review all information received through VIBE along with the evidence submitted by the petitioner or applicant and will use the information from VIBE to verify the petitioner’s qualifications. For example, if a petitioner is seeking L-1 status for a beneficiary, VIBE will help USCIS officers confirm that the petitioner has a foreign affiliate, which is a requirement for granting L-1 status. They will also use the information from VIBE to validate the bona fides of the employer when certain employment-based applicants file for lawful permanent resident status.
Information from VIBE will also help to confirm an employer's financial viability and operational status for petitions and applications where a job offer is required. USCIS will not deny a petition or an application solely based upon information from VIBE. If USCIS officers find significant data discrepancy between the evidence submitted by the petitioner or applicant and the information presented in VIBE, they will give the petitioner or applicant the opportunity to respond to the agency’s concerns. USCIS may issue an RFE or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) if it is necessary to resolve relevant inconsistencies or other issues that emerge upon review of VIBE-supplied information that are material to the benefit requested.
USCIS will then make a final decision based on the totality of the circumstances.
Your Company’s or Organization’s Information in VIBE
USCIS does not require companies and organizations to create or update records with D&B; however, you may choose to create, verify, or correct your company or organization’s information with D&B.
If your entity is a U.S.-based privately held company or organization and you would like to create, verify or correct its D&B record, you may contact D&B directly online through iUpdate for U.S. government customers. Contacting D&B through this link will allow you to create, update and view basic elements of your company’s or organization’s D&B report without being subjected to direct marketing from D&B. It is only available for U.S.-based privately held companies and other U.S. government customers.
iUpdate for U.S. government customers is a free, password-protected and encrypted online service tool offered by D&B. Its users will be asked a series of short challenge questions, based on geographical and demographic data, to authenticate and establish an ID and password. Only those with access to your established ID and password will be able to access your business information.
If you are a U.S.-based publicly traded company, government entity, or foreign company and you want to create, update or view your report with D&B, you may use dnb.com.  
Please be aware that if you update your information through dnb.com, you may be subjected to direct marketing from D&B. D&B representatives may suggest that you purchase products and services from D&B. USCIS does not endorse D&B or its products or services, and does not in any way suggest that you purchase products or services from D&B in order to ensure your information is complete. Additionally, USCIS does not in any way suggest that you pay any fee to expedite the creation of a new record or to update an existing record.
There is no fee to check, update or create a record for your company or organization with D&B.
Please note that whether or not you choose to create a record or update your record with D&B, you must respond to any RFE or NOID you receive from USCIS. Failure to respond directly to USCIS could result in the denial of your petition.

However, if the employer is listed as “Self/Individual” on the Form I-485 Supplement J, USCIS will not use VIBE because an individual’s information is not included in VIBE.
Classifications Not Included in VIBE
Due to their unique eligibility requirements, the following employment-based classifications are not included in VIBE at this time:
CW-1, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)-only transitional worker
E-2C, long-term foreign investors in the CNMI
E11, individuals of extraordinary ability
E21, national interest waiver
EB-5, immigrant investor
O, individuals with extraordinary ability or achievement (including essential support personnel)
P, internationally recognized athletes and entertainment groups, performers under a reciprocal exchange program, and artists or entertainers under a culturally unique program (including essential support personnel)

Goals of VIBE
The use of VIBE is expected to enhance USCIS’ ability to distinguish eligible petitioners and applicants from those who may be ineligible, and thus make reviews by USCIS officers more efficient.
The use of VIBE should reduce the need for companies and organizations to submit identical paper documentation with each petition to establish their current level of business operations. Through VIBE, USCIS should also be able to reduce the number of RFEs issued to otherwise eligible petitioners or applicants.
By providing the same petitioner and applicant information to all five USCIS service centers, VIBE promotes the consistent review of employment-based immigrant and nonimmigrant filings. Overall, the information VIBE provides improves the integrity of employment-based immigrant and nonimmigrant programs and the process for petitioners seeking foreign workers to employ.
Feedback about VIBE
USCIS may send to some petitioners or applicants an RFE or NOID that references information VIBE has received from the IIP. Petitioners or applicants MUST respond to these RFEs or NOIDs; failure to respond may result in the denial of the petition or application.
Customers may email to USCIS their questions about RFEs or NOIDs involving IIP information we received through VIBE, as well as suggestions for improving the program, to VIBE-Feedback@dhs.gov."
VIBE Questions and Answers,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/information-for-employers-and-employees/employer-information/vibe/vibe-questions-and-answers,"
The web-based Validation Instrument for Business Enterprises (VIBE) is a tool designed to enhance USCIS’ adjudications of certain employment-based immigration petitions and applications.
VIBE uses commercially available data from an independent information provider (IIP) to validate basic information about companies or organizations petitioning to employ certain aliens and to validate the basic information about the companies or organizations listed on:
Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker;
Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker;
Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant; and
Form I-485 Supplement J, Confirmation of Bona Fide Job Offer or Request for Job Portability Under INA Section 204(j).

Currently, the independent information provider for the VIBE program is Dun and Bradstreet (D&B).
Q1. What is VIBE?
A1. VIBE is a web-based tool that uses commercially available data to validate basic information about companies or organizations petitioning to employ certain aliens and to validate the basic information about the companies or organizations listed on the Form I-485 Supplement J. A main goal of VIBE is to equip USCIS Officers with information from an independent source that they can use to help determine petitioners’ or applicants’ eligibility.
Q2. Which petitions or applications are included in VIBE?
A2. VIBE includes most employment-based petitions filed by companies and organizations and also validates the bona fides of the employer when certain employment-based applicants file for lawful permanent resident status, including:
Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker.
Form I-140, Immigration Petition for Alien Worker.
Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er) or Special Immigrant.
Form I-485 Supplement J,  Confirmation of Bona Fide Job Offer or Request for Job Portability Under INA Section 204(j)
	See uscis.gov/vibe for a complete list of immigrant and nonimmigrant classifications included in VIBE.
At this time, VIBE is not used for the following employment-based petition classifications due to their unique eligibility requirements:


See uscis.gov/vibe for a complete list of immigrant and nonimmigrant classifications included in VIBE.
At this time, VIBE is not used for the following employment-based petition classifications due to their unique eligibility requirements:
CW-1, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)-only transitional worker
E-2C, long-term foreign investors in the CNMI
E11, individuals of extraordinary ability
E21, national interest waiver
EB-5, immigrant investor
O, individuals with extraordinary ability or achievement (including essential support personnel)
P, internationally recognized athletes and entertainment groups, performers under a reciprocal exchange program, and artists or entertainers under a culturally unique program (including essential support personnel)

Q3. What information does VIBE provide to USCIS officers?
A3. VIBE provides USCIS officers with information on the employer’s  business operations, including information related to:
Business activities, such as type of business (North American Industry Classification System code), trade payment information, and status (active or inactive)
Financial standing, including sales volume and credit standing
Number of employees, both on-site and globally
Relationships with other entities, including foreign affiliates
Type of office (Examples include single entities, branches, subsidiaries and headquarters)
Type of legal entity (For example, LLC, partnership or corporation)
Company executives
Date of establishment as a business entity
Current physical address

Q4. Will a final decision be based solely on information obtained through VIBE?
A4. No. VIBE is an additional tool for USCIS officers to use in the overall adjudicative process. USCIS will not deny a petition or an application solely based upon information from VIBE. USCIS will issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) if derogatory or contradictory information is found in VIBE that is material to the benefit requested and is not outweighed by evidence submitted with the petition or application. USCIS will make a final decision based on the totality of the circumstances.
Q5. How will I know if I received an RFE or NOID due to a VIBE-related issue?
A5. The RFE or NOID will clearly state that the employer information has been checked in VIBE, and will describe the relevant derogatory or contradictory information found.
Q6. If I receive an RFE or NOID for a VIBE-related issue, am I required to update my company’s record with D&B?
A6. No.  However, you may choose to contact D&B to update the record to prevent any future applications or petitions from receiving a similar RFE or NOID for the VIBE-related issue in question.
You must respond to USCIS with the information requested in the RFE or NOID regardless of whether you choose to update your record with D&B.
Q7. Do I need to respond to USCIS if I update my company’s record with D&B after receiving an RFE or NOID?
A7. Yes. You must respond to USCIS with the requested additional information after receiving an RFE or a NOID. Updating your company’s record with D&B is not a substitute for responding to USCIS’ RFE or NOID. If you do not respond to the RFE or NOID directly to USCIS, we may deny your petition or application. 
Q8. Are there any additional USCIS fees for filing a petition or an application subject to VIBE?
A8. No. There are no additional fees associated with VIBE. You must still comply with all other fee requirements for the requested classification. Visit uscis.gov/fees for information about current fees.
Q9. Does VIBE require any additional documentary filing requirements?
A9. No. VIBE does not require you to file additional documentation. However, it is critical that you accurately provide your business name and address on the USCIS form. This helps USCIS match information from the form with information received through VIBE. If you list an attorney’s or representative’s address in the form’s Petitioner Information section or Employer Information section, USCIS may issue you an RFE.
Q10. When filing a Form I-140 for a classification included in VIBE, do I still need to submit evidence of ability to pay?
A10. Yes. You must continue to submit evidence with a Form I-140 to demonstrate the organization’s ability to pay the proffered wage from the time the priority date was established until the beneficiary obtains lawful permanent resident status.
Although VIBE helps USCIS Officers by independently validating an employer’s business operations, the information provided to USCIS through VIBE is not a substitute for the required evidence of ability to pay specified in the regulations.
Q11. How will using VIBE affect processing times for employment-based petitions or applications?
A11. The use of VIBE will not change USCIS’s overall processing-time goals as long as no relevant derogatory or contradictory information is found. If derogatory or contradictory information is found, you may experience prolonged processing due to the time required to complete the RFE, NOID or administrative inquiry. On the other hand, the use of VIBE may allow USCIS to resolve inconsistencies in the record, potentially reducing the need to issue RFEs.
USCIS’s goal for VIBE is to gradually reduce processing times for most employment-based petitions.
Q12. How can I view the information in my company’s or organization’s D&B report?
A12. As of December 2011, a U.S.-based privately held company or organization may view, at no cost, the basic elements contained in its D&B report by using D&B’s new Update for US government customers.
Contacting D&B from this link will allow U.S.-based privately held USCIS petitioners and other U.S. government customers to create, update and view their company’s or organization’s D&B record without being subjected to direct marketing from D&B.
When using this process for government customers, D&B must verify the user’s personal identity and affiliation with the selected company or organization. Update for U.S. government customers users will be asked a series of short challenge questions, based on geographical and demographic data, to authenticate and establish an ID and password. Only those with access to your established ID and password will be able to access your business’ or organization’s information.
For additional information of how D&B collects, manages, shares and protects information, please review its privacy policy at dnb.com/US/home/privacy_policy/index.html.
To maintain accuracy of significant business information, D&B requires certain change requests to be verified by a third party prior to entry into the D&B system.

D&B’s iUpdate for U.S. government customers is not available to U.S.-based publicly traded companies, government entities or foreign companies. Such entities wishing to create, update or view their report with D&B may use dnb.com. Organizations accessing dnb.com may be subjected to direct marketing from D&B.
Q13. Is there a fee for viewing or updating my company or organization’s information or D&B report?
A13. No. There is no fee for a company or organization to create a record with D&B, view the basic elements in the D&B report or update its information with D&B. USCIS does not require an employer to purchase products or services from D&B in order to ensure its information is accurate, nor does USCIS require the employer to pay any fee to expedite the creation of a new record or for the updating of an existing record with D&B. Moreover, the use of D&B as an IIP for VIBE is not in any way an endorsement of D&B or its services.
Q14. When I requested my report from D&B, I found that D&B does not yet have any information about my company or organization. What should I do?
A14. USCIS does not require employers’ information to be available through D&B when they file with USCIS.
D&B has developed a 9-digit identification sequence, known as the D-U-N-S® Number, that provides a unique identifier of single business entities while linking corporate family structures together. You may request a D-U-N-S® Number from D&B if you find that the firm does not yet have any information about your company or organization. However, USCIS does not require employers to have a D-U-N-S® Number or include a D-U-N-S® Number when filing with USCIS.
It is important to note that USCIS will not automatically issue an RFE or NOID if an employer’s information is not included in the D&B database. As part of the adjudication, USCIS will also review information found in the evidence submitted with the petition or application and, if needed, additional publicly available information (such as the relevant Office of the Secretary of State’s business registrations). USCIS will make a final decision based on the totality of the circumstances.
A U.S.-based privately held company or organization may contact D&B to request a D-U-N-S® Number by using D&B’s iUpdate for US government customers. U.S.-based publicly traded companies, government entities and foreign entities may contact D&B via dnb.com.
For more information about the D-U-N-S® Number, visit dnb.com.
Q15. How long does it take for D&B to update information about a company or organization?
A15. D&B generally completes its verification process within 2 to 7 business days, upon which the updated information is included in the customer’s record. D&B generally fulfills requests for new D-U-N-S® Numbers within 30 days. You may contact D&B for more information.
Q16. If I contact D&B through the iUpdate service for U.S. government customers, will I be offered commercial services or products?
A16. No. By contacting D&B through this link, certain USCIS customers and other U.S. government customers will be able to create, update and view the basic elements of their company’s or organization’s D&B report without being subjected to direct marketing from D&B.
Q17. If I contact D&B through their website, can I be offered commercial services or products from D&B?
A17. Yes. USCIS wants to ensure that the public is aware that D&B representatives may suggest that you purchase products and services from them if you contact D&B through dnb.com. However, USCIS does not endorse D&B or its products or services, and does not in any way suggest that you purchase products or services from D&B in order to ensure your information is complete. Additionally, USCIS does not in any way suggest that you pay any fee to expedite the creation of a new record or to update an existing record.

Employment Authorization,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/information-for-employers-and-employees/employer-information/employment-authorization,"
U.S. employers must check to make sure all employees, regardless of citizenship or national origin, are allowed to work in the United States. If you are not a citizen or a lawful permanent resident, you may need to prove that you can work in the United States by presenting an Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766/EAD). You may apply for an EAD if you are eligible.
USCIS issues the following types of EADs:
Initial EAD: This document proves you are allowed to work in the United States.
Renewal EAD: This document renews your initial EAD. Generally, you should not file for a renewal EAD more than 180 days before your original EAD expires.
Replacement EAD: This document replaces a lost, stolen, or mutilated EAD.  A replacement EAD also replaces an EAD that was issued with incorrect information, such as a misspelled name.

Note: In addition, certain B-1 nonimmigrant visitors are issued EADs.
Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, asks for your eligibility category. It is important that you write the correct eligibility category on your application. 
Please see the Form I-765 instructions  (PDF, 618.16 KB) for a complete list of eligibility categories. You may also find eligibility categories in section 274a.12, title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
Form I-765V, Application for Employment Authorization for Abused Nonimmigrant Spouse, asks for your eligibility category. It is important that you write the correct eligibility category on your application. 
Please see the Form I-765V instructions  (PDF, 618.16 KB) for a complete list of eligibility categories. You may also find eligibility categories in section 274a.12, title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

Employer Information,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/information-for-employers-and-employees/employer-information,"
As an employer, you may need to hire foreign labor when a U.S. citizen is not available. First, you will need to consider whether you intend to employ the individual permanently or temporarily. Offering an noncitizen a permanent position could provide the basis for that individual to become a permanent resident, a process which will require that the individual file an additional application and satisfy separate requirements.
Permanent Workers
Foreign workers may obtain permanent residence (a Green Card) if they are able to establish that they have unique skills, or are being offered a job in the United States that will not displace a U.S. worker or have an adverse effect on wages and working conditions of U.S. workers who are similarly employed. This latter determination is made by the Department of Labor and is demonstrated by obtaining a labor certification.
Permanent worker visas are broken into five preference categories. For a description of the preference categories, see the Permanent Workers page.
Department of Labor: Labor Certification
A U.S. employer who is “sponsoring” or petitioning for a permanent foreign worker may be required to obtain a labor certification from the Department of Labor (DOL) verifying that there are an insufficient number of available, qualified, and willing U.S. workers to fill the position, and that the employment will not have an adverse effect on the wages and working conditions of similarly situated U.S. workers. For more information, see the Permanent Labor Certification page.
Obtaining Permanent Residence (a Green Card) Through a Job Offer
For information on how you can obtain a Green Card, see the Green Card for Employment-Based Immigrants page
Temporary Workers
There are several temporary (nonimmigrant) categories which allow noncitizens to work in the United States. For a list of these nonimmigrant categories of temporary workers, as well as information on the petitioning process, see the Temporary Workers page.
Department of Labor: Labor Condition Application
Some nonimmigrant categories require that a U.S. employer obtain a certification of labor condition application from the Department of Labor. That application requires the employer to state (“attest”) that it will comply with the following requirements:
The employer must pay a wage that is no less than the wage paid to similarly qualified workers or, if greater, the prevailing wage for the position in the geographic area.
The employer must provide working conditions that will not adversely affect other similarly employed workers.
The employer must attest that there is no strike or lockout at the place of business of the prospective temporary worker.
The employer must give notice to the bargaining representative or post a notice at the place of business that a labor condition application has been filed with the DOL.

How to Verify Employment Eligibility (Form I-9 and E-Verify)
All U.S. employers must verify the employment eligibility and identity of all employees hired to work in the United States after Nov. 6, 1986, by completing an Employment Eligibility Verification form (Form I-9) for all employees, including U.S. citizens. Employers who hire or continue to employ individuals knowing that they are not authorized to be employed in the United States may face civil and criminal penalties.

DHS Support of the Enforcement of Labor and Employment Laws,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/information-for-employers-and-employees/dhs-support-of-the-enforcement-of-labor-and-employment-laws,"
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security plays an important role in ensuring that our nation's workplaces comply with our laws by supporting federal, state, and local labor and employment agencies to accomplish their important work enforcing wage protections, workplace safety, labor rights, and other laws and standards. See the Oct. 12, 2021, DHS Policy Statement 065-06, “Worksite Enforcement: The Strategy to Protect the American Labor Market, the Conditions of the American Worksite, and the Dignity of the Individual.”
Workers are sometimes afraid to report violations of law by exploitative employers or to cooperate in employment and labor standards investigations because they fear removal or other immigration-related retaliation due to reports by an abusive employer. DHS’s practice of offering discretionary protection on a case-by-case basis to victims who lack employment authorization directly increases the ability of labor and employment agencies to more fully investigate worksite violations. Offering discretionary protection also supports these agencies in fulfilling their mission and holding abusive employers accountable, which protects all U.S. workers. The process changes announced today will streamline the exercise of DHS’s existing authority to grant such protection.
For Labor Agencies Submitting a Statement of Interest Form
Multiple mechanisms in our immigration laws can provide employment authorization to noncitizen workers and protect them from removal, including discretionary relief such as deferred action or parole in place and other forms of relief such as T and U nonimmigrant visas. There are also circumstances where a labor or employment agency may request expedited processing of a worker’s pending application, petition, or request.
Labor and employment agencies can seek DHS support in an ongoing investigation or enforcement action by contacting laborenforcement@dhs.gov, and including “a statement of interest” that addresses the following:
Details the nature of their investigation and the need for DHS support;
Describes the agency’s enforcement interests that provide the basis for their request;
Describes the worksite and the workers who may be helpful with the agency investigation; and
Provides an agency point of contact who can address follow up questions from DHS.

In addition, labor agencies can seek expedited processing of a worker’s pending immigration benefit request. Such requests must be made by a senior-level official. If the request relates to employment authorization, the request should demonstrate that the need for a person to be employment-authorized is mission-critical and goes beyond a general need to retain a particular worker or person. Examples include, but are not limited to, a noncitizen victim or witness cooperating with a federal, state, or local agency who is in need of employment authorization because the respective agency is seeking back pay or reinstatement in an enforcement action or other court proceeding. When labor agencies submit a Statement of Interest, DHS aims to review submissions within 3 business days. DHS will notify the labor agency whether the Statement of Interest has been accepted or whether further information is needed. Labor agencies should not distribute the Statement of Interest until DHS has confirmed acceptance. 
If a labor agency would like more information before submitting a Statement of Interest, please e-mail laborenforcement@dhs.gov to request a briefing with DHS.
Process for Workers Requesting Deferred Action
Deferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action (deportation) against a noncitizen for a certain period. Although deferred action does not confer lawful status or excuse any past or future periods of unlawful presence, a noncitizen granted deferred action is considered lawfully present in the United States for certain limited purposes while the deferred action is in effect. DHS can terminate deferred action at any time, at its discretion.
Under existing regulations, a noncitizen granted deferred action may apply for and obtain employment authorization for the period of deferred action if they demonstrate “an economic necessity for employment.”
Noncitizen workers who fall within the scope of a labor agency investigation can submit their requests for deferred action to USCIS through a central intake point specifically established to handle requests for deferred action related to labor agency investigative efforts. USCIS will forward to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) any requests for deferred action from noncitizens who are in removal proceedings or have a final order of removal, so ICE can consider the request for deferred action.
As with any request for deferred action, DHS will review requests based on a labor agency investigation on a case-by-case basis. DHS will review all positive and negative factors when considering whether to exercise discretion to grant deferred action.
To request labor agency-investigation-based deferred action under this centralized intake process, requestors must submit the following:
A written request signed by the noncitizen stating the basis for the deferred action request;
A letter or statement of interest from a labor or employment agency addressed to DHS supporting the request;
Evidence to establish that the worker falls within the scope identified in the labor or employment agency letter, such as W-2s, pay stubs, time cards, or other documentary evidence to demonstrate that the worker was employed during the period identified in the labor or employment agency statement;
Evidence of any additional factors supporting a favorable exercise of discretion;
Proof of the noncitizen’s identity and nationality;
If applicable, any document used to lawfully enter the United States or other evidence relating to the noncitizen’s immigration history or status;
Form G-325A, Biographic Information (for Deferred Action);
Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with the appropriate fee or request for a fee waiver; and
Form I-765WS, Worksheet

FAQs
Q1: What is deferred action?
A1: Deferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action (deportation) against a noncitizen for a certain period. Although deferred action does not confer lawful status or excuse any past or future periods of unlawful presence, a noncitizen granted deferred action is considered lawfully present in the United States for certain limited purposes, while the deferred action is in effect. If granted deferred action, a noncitizen may be eligible for employment authorization. DHS can terminate deferred action at any time, at its discretion.
Q2. Has DHS already granted deferred action to noncitizens who are participating in labor agency investigations?
A2. Yes. DHS grants deferred action to noncitizen workers on a case-by-case basis at its discretion.
Q3. How does the centralized deferred action process work?
A3. A noncitizen requesting labor agency investigation-based deferred action submits a written request for deferred action by submitting:
A request for deferred action signed by the noncitizen which describes the basis for their request for deferred action;
A copy of the letter issued by the labor or employment agency addressed to DHS detailing the nature of the investigation or prosecution and the need for DHS support;
Evidence to establish that the worker falls within the category of workers identified in the labor or employment agency’s letter, such as W-2s, pay stubs, time cards, or other documentary evidence to demonstrate that the worker was employed during the period in the labor or employment agency statement;
Evidence of any additional factors supporting a favorable exercise of discretion;
Proof of the noncitizen’s identity and nationality;
If applicable, any document used to lawfully enter the U.S. or other evidence relating to the noncitizen’s immigration history or status;
Form G-325A, Biographic Information (for Deferred Action);
Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with the applicable, non-refundable fee; and, Application for Employment Authorization, with the applicable, non-refundable fee; and
Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, if applicable.

The noncitizen will submit this request to a central intake point at USCIS specifically established to support labor agency investigative and enforcement efforts. USCIS will refer to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) any deferred action requests that fall within ICE’s authority, including requests submitted by noncitizens who are in removal proceedings or have a final order of removal.
As with any request for deferred action, DHS will review requests by workers based on a labor agency investigation on a case-by-case basis. DHS will review all positive and negative factors present in the requestor’s case when considering whether to exercise discretion to grant deferred action.
A worker who is participating in or otherwise involved in a labor agency investigation may request deferred action for a period of up to two years.
Q4. Can a noncitizen worker who would otherwise fit within the scope of a labor-related request for prosecutorial discretion described in this FAQ but who does not want to submit a Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, request deferred action?
A4. Yes. A noncitizen worker who falls within the scope of a labor agency investigation but who does not want to submit a Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, may request deferred action by submitting their request to the appropriate field office in accordance with the general instructions for requesting deferred action.
Q5. May a noncitizen granted deferred action be eligible for employment authorization?
A5. Individuals granted deferred action may be eligible for employment authorization under category 8 C.F.R. 274a.12(c)(14), under existing regulations that require them to demonstrate an economic necessity for employment. Noncitizens submitting a deferred action request through this centralized process must concurrently submit their Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with the appropriate fee. If we grant deferred action, we will adjudicate the Form I-765. Note that if we do not grant deferred action, we will not refund or return the Form I-765 fee. If the requestor does not want to file Form I-765, they can send their request using the standard procedure (sending it to the USCIS field office).
Q6. What agency will be reviewing requests for deferred action from noncitizen workers?
A6. Requests for deferred action made by noncitizen workers who are participating in or otherwise necessary to a labor agency investigation may be submitted to USCIS through the central intake point specifically established to support labor agency investigative efforts for deferred action requests. USCIS will review the request, as well as the worker’s immigration history, to determine which office within DHS has authority over the request. Upon reviewing the submission for completeness, USCIS will only forward to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) requests for deferred action that are submitted by noncitizens who are in removal proceedings or have a final order of removal. USCIS and ICE, as appropriate, will consider and make a case-by-case determination of the deferred action request and USCIS will consider all related Forms I-765, if submitted.
Q7. If deferred action is granted through this process, when does it end?
A7. If deferred action is approved, it may be granted for a period of up to two years, subject to termination at any time. The recipient may also be eligible to make subsequent requests for deferred action, which will be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis when a labor agency provides a basis for such a request as it relates to the labor agency’s ongoing investigative or enforcement interests.
Q8. What other immigration benefits can a noncitizen worker pursue if they are not granted deferred action?
A8. A noncitizen worker who is the victim of a crime or subject to exploitation by an unscrupulous employer and cooperating in a labor agency investigation may be eligible for other forms of immigration relief beyond deferred action, including eligibility for a T or U nonimmigrant visa or parole in place.
Q9. How can a labor agency find out more about this process?
A9. Labor agency representatives can contact laborenforcement@dhs.gov to learn more about this process.
Q10. A labor agency submitted a Statement of Interest. Can the labor agency distribute the Statement of Interest to workers to submit as part of their deferred action request?
A10. When labor agencies submit a Statement of Interest, DHS aims to review submissions within 3 business days. DHS will notify the labor agency whether the Statement of Interest has been accepted or whether further information is needed. Labor agencies should not distribute the Statement of Interest until DHS has confirmed acceptance.
Q11: Will I receive a Social Security Number?
A11. In most cases, when you apply for employment authorization using Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, you can apply for a Social Security Number (SSN) and a new or replacement Social Security card on the same form. If USCIS approves your Form I-765 and you completed the section on the application authorizing USCIS to provide your information to the Social Security Administration (SSA), then USCIS will send SSA the data needed to assign you a SSN and issue your Social Security card.
In such cases, if USCIS approves your Form I-765, then you will receive two documents – your Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document, also known as an EAD, from USCIS, and in another envelope from SSA, your Social Security card. The SSA will mail your Social Security card to the address you listed on your Form I-765. You should receive your Social Security card no later than seven business days after you receive your EAD from USCIS.
If you do not receive your SSN card within seven business days after receiving your EAD, please call or visit an SSA office. For more information, please review this flyer: Apply for your Social Security Number While Applying for your Work Permit (PDF, 400.77 KB).
Q12: Will DHS consider a request submitted by a labor or employment agency to expedite a worker’s pending immigration benefit request on the basis of a labor agency’s need?
A12. Yes. On a case-by-case basis, USCIS will consider a request submitted by a senior-level official of the labor or employment agency for expedited processing of a worker’s pending immigration benefit request, including but not limited to Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, submitted outside of a request for labor investigation-based deferred action under the centralized intake process, Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, From I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, U Bona Fide Determination, or other pending immigration benefit request.
If the expedite request relates to employment authorization, the request should demonstrate   a critical and otherwise compelling need for a person to be employment-authorized. Examples include, but are not limited to, a noncitizen victim or witness cooperating with a federal, state, or local agency who is in need of employment authorization because the respective agency is seeking back pay or reinstatement in an enforcement action or other court proceeding. 
More information on how to request expedited processing can be found on the How to Make an Expedite Request page."
Information for Employers and Employees,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/information-for-employers-and-employees,"
Employers must verify that an individual whom they plan to employ or continue to employ in the United States is authorized to accept employment in the United States. For more information about the employment authorization verification process, see our I-9 Central page.
As an employer, you may require the services of a noncitizen to work at your company or business. If the individual is already a permanent resident (Green Card holder), you may hire that individual, but you must comply with the employment verification requirements.
If the noncitizen is not already a permanent resident, you will need to file a petition so that the individual may obtain the appropriate immigrant or nonimmigrant classification.  You may choose to file an immigrant petition (permanent) or a nonimmigrant petition (temporary) on behalf of that employee. 
No noncitizen may accept employment in the United States unless they have been authorized to do so. Some noncitizen, such as those who have been admitted as permanent residents, granted asylum or refugee status, or admitted in work-related nonimmigrant classifications, may have employment authorization as a direct result of their immigration status. Other noncitizens may need to apply individually for employment authorization.
There are many ways in which a person may be able to work in the United States. You may seek an immigration classification that permits you to live and work in the United States permanently or temporarily. In most instances, your employer or potential employer must petition for you. In this Working in the United States section, you will find information about coming to the United States to work temporarily or permanently and the many different eligibility categories for working in the United States.
Employers who employ foreign workers may be subject to special U.S. tax withholding rules. 
Foreign nationals employed in the U.S. may have a U.S. tax obligation. Please see the Taxation of Resident Aliens, Taxation of Nonresident Aliens, and the Tax Information and Responsibilities for New Immigrants to the United States pages on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website for more information.  
 In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about Foreign Workers and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website.

Note, however, that if such persons engage in activities outside their B-1 nonimmigrant status, such as working for another employer in the United States, they will be found to have violated their B-1 nonimmigrant status. They also may not remain in the United States for longer than the authorized period of stay in B-1 nonimmigrant status."
Temporary Visitors for Business,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-visitors-for-business,"
To visit the United States for business, you need to obtain a temporary visitors for business visa, unless you qualify for admission without a visa under the Visa Waiver Program.
The table below describes the different classifications of temporary business visitors. For more information on eligibility and the application process, see the links in the chart below."
Students and Employment,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment,"
If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
You must be enrolled in an ""academic"" educational program, a language-training program, or a vocational program
Your school must be approved by the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement
You must be enrolled as a full-time student at the institution
You must be proficient in English or be enrolled in courses leading to English proficiency
You must have sufficient funds available for self-support during the entire proposed course of study
You must maintain a residence abroad which you have no intention of giving up.

The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
Curricular Practical Training (CPT)
Optional Practical Training (OPT) (pre-completion or post-completion)
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Optional Practical Training Extension (OPT)

F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website. 
If you are interested in changing to F or M Student Status, see the Changing to a Nonimmigrant F or M Student Status page."
Changing to a Nonimmigrant F or M Student Status,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment/changing-to-a-nonimmigrant-f-or-m-student-status,"
It depends. Some statuses permit you to enroll in school, while other statuses do not. For example, the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(b)(7) specifically prohibit a course of study in the United States while in B-1 or B-2 status. However, no such prohibition exists for those in E status, so individuals in that status can enroll in school as long as it does not interfere with their ability to maintain their E status.
Individuals in a nonimmigrant status that prohibits enrolling in school must first acquire F-1 (academic student) or M-1 (vocational student) status. Enrolling in a course of study while in a status that does not permit such activity will result in a status violation. Individuals who have violated their nonimmigrant status by enrolling in a course of study are not eligible to extend their status or change to F-1 or M-1 status.
If you are in the United States in valid nonimmigrant status for a purpose other than to attend school and wish to change your nonimmigrant status   (PDF) to a student status while remaining in the United States, you must meet the criteria below and submit an application with USCIS to change your status. 
In general, you may apply to change your nonimmigrant status while remaining in the United States if:
You were lawfully admitted to the United States in a nonimmigrant status;
Your nonimmigrant status remains valid;
You have not violated the conditions of your status; and
You have not committed any crimes or engaged in any other actions that would make you ineligible for change of status.

Until you receive notice of approval from USCIS, do not assume the requested status has been approved. Before USCIS may approve your application, you must take the following steps: 
Apply to and receive acceptance from a U.S. Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school.
Obtain an initial Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status, from the SEVP-certified school. The Designated School Official (DSO) should give change of status in the Issue Reason section of the Form I-20.
Pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee.
File a Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, with USCIS.

Not all nonimmigrant classifications are allowed to change to student status. Read the Form I-539 instructions carefully to ensure that your category is eligible.
If you are requesting to change from another nonimmigrant status to F or M student status and your current nonimmigrant status does not permit you to enroll in classes, do not enroll in classes or begin your studies until USCIS has approved your change of status. If USCIS has not adjudicated your change of status at least 15 days before the program start date on your Form I-20, contact the designated school official (DSO) at your new school. If USCIS does not grant your request to change status prior to the start date of classes, you may need to defer attendance and wait until the following term in order to begin your studies at the school in F or M status.
Please note that if you are applying to change status to M status, you must maintain a valid nonimmigrant status while your Form I-539 change of status application is pending.
We encourage all students and prospective students to work closely with their DSO to coordinate the timing of applying for change of status and enrolling in a course of study.
NOTE: If you are an M-1 student, you may not change to F status while you are in the United States.
Due to processing times, you may have to request that your DSO defer the F-1 program start date to the following academic term or semester because USCIS did not make a decision on your Form I-539 change of status application before your originally intended F-1 program start date. If your COS application is approved, your change of status to F-1 will be effective as of the date of approval. You are not required to obtain status all the way up to the date that is 30 days before your program start date (“bridge the gap”), provided that your nonimmigrant status is unexpired at the time of filing the change of status to F-1 application, and you otherwise remain eligible for a change of status.
If we approve an application more than 30 days before your program start date, you must ensure that you do not violate your F-1 status. An example of a violation would be engaging in employment, including on-campus employment and practical training, more than 30 days before the program start date as listed on your Form I-20.
If your current nonimmigrant status will expire more than 30 days before your M-1 program start date and you wish to remain in the United States until your start date, you must find a way to obtain status all the way up to the date that is 30 days before your program start date (“bridge the gap”). For most people, you will need to file a separate Form I-539 to request to extend your current status or change to another nonimmigrant status, in addition to your other Form I-539 application to change to student status. If you do not file this separate request before your status expires, USCIS will deny your Form I-539 request to change to M-1 status. Please continue to check the USCIS processing times while your Form I-539 change of status request is pending to determine if you need to file a request to extend or change your nonimmigrant status. 
Note that because of processing times, you may have to request that your DSO defer the M-1 program start date to the following term or semester because USCIS did not make a decision on your Form I-539 change of status application before your originally intendedM-1 program start date. In that instance, you will need to obtain status all the way up to the date which is 30 days before your new program start date. If you had already filed an I-539 to bridge the original gap, you may need to file another I-539 to bridge the new gap.

Because extending or changing nonimmigrant status to bridge the gap and changing to M-1 status are two distinct benefits, you must pay a separate filing fee for each request. See the User Fee Statute, 31 U.S.C. § 9701. 
You may consider consular processing if you are concerned about maintaining your nonimmigrant status to within 30 days of your M-1 program start date (which may be deferred as described above) or are otherwise not eligible to change status to F-1 or M-1 status in the United States. You will need to do the following:
Apply to and receive acceptance from a SEVP-certified school.
Receive a new initial Form I-20 from your designated school official (DSO).
Pay the I-901 SEVIS fee.
Apply at a U.S. consulate or embassy for an F-1 or M-1 visa to travel to the United States in order to seek admission as a student.
If you are from a country where no visa is required, such as Canada, you may proceed directly to a U.S. port of entry or a U.S. pre-clearance/pre-flight inspection station and apply for admission to the United States as an F-1 or M-1 student.
Once admitted by an immigration officer in F-1 or M-1 status, you may begin your studies.

For more information about consular processing, please visit the Department of State Travel page. For information about SEVP, please visit the ICE Student and Exchange Visitor Program page or the DHS Study in the States page."
Exchange Visitors,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/exchange-visitors,"
The J-1 classification (exchange visitors) is authorized for those who intend to participate in an approved program for the purpose of teaching, instructing or lecturing, studying, observing, conducting research, consulting, demonstrating special skills, receiving training, or to receive graduate medical education or training.
In carrying out the responsibilities of the Exchange Visitor Program, the Department of State designates public and private entities to act as exchange sponsors. J-1 nonimmigrants are therefore sponsored by an exchange program that is designated as such by the U.S. Department of State. These programs are designed to promote the interchange of persons, knowledge, and skills, in the fields of education, arts, and science.
In January 2022, DOS announced measures to increase the flow of talent in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The Early Career STEM Research Initiative connects certain J-1 program sponsors with STEM-relevant sponsors, including businesses.
Information on the education, experience, and skills required to qualify is available at the DOS website.
Examples of exchange visitors include, but are not limited to:
Professors or scholars
Research assistants
Students
Trainees
Teachers
Specialists
Au pairs
Camp counselors

Application Process
The U.S. Department of State plays the primary role in administering the J-1 exchange visitor program, so the first step in obtaining a J-1 visa is to submit a Form DS-2019, Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor Status, (formerly known as an IAP-66). Your sponsoring agency will provide you this form. You should work closely with the officials at your sponsoring agency who will be assisting you through this process. An official who is authorized to issue Form DS-2019 is known as a responsible officer (RO) or alternate responsible officer (ARO). Your RO or ARO will explain to you what documents are needed in order to be issued a DS-2019.
After you have obtained a Form DS-2019, you may then apply for a J-1 visa through the U.S. Department of State at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. The waiting time for an interview appointment for applicants can vary, so submitting your visa application as early as possible is strongly encouraged (though you may not enter the United States in J-1 status more than 30 days before your program begins).
Employment
Some J-1 nonimmigrants enter the United States specifically to work while others do not. Employment is authorized for J-1 nonimmigrants only under the terms of the exchange program. Please check with your sponsoring agency for more information on any restrictions that may apply to you working in the United States.
Family of J-1 Visa Holders
Your spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age, regardless of nationality, are entitled to J-2 classification. Your spouse and children are entitled to employment authorization; however, their income may not be used to support you. To apply for employment authorization as a J-2 nonimmigrant, your spouse or child would file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. For more information on the application procedures, see the “Employment Authorization” page.

Conrad 30 Waiver Program,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/conrad-30-waiver-program,"
The Conrad 30 waiver program allows J-1 foreign medical graduates (FMGs) to apply for a waiver of the 2-year foreign residence requirement upon completion of the J-1 exchange visitor program. See section 214(l) of the Immigration Nationality Act (INA). The program addresses the shortage of qualified doctors in medically underserved areas.
Eligibility
Although each state has developed its own application rules and guidelines, the following program requirements apply to all J-1 foreign medical graduates.
The J-1 foreign medical graduate must:
Have been admitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the INA to receive graduate medical training;
Enter into a bona fide, full-time employment contract to practice medicine in H-1B nonimmigrant status for at least 3 years at a health care facility located in an area designated by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA), Medically Underserved Area (MUA), or Medically Underserved Population (MUP) or serving patients who reside in a HPSA, MUA, or MUP.
Obtain a “no objection” statement in writing from their home country if they are contractually obligated to return to their home country upon completion of the exchange program.
Agree to begin employment at the health care facility, specified in the waiver application, within 90 days of receipt of the waiver, not the date their J-1 visa expires.

See each state’s public health department (or its equivalent) website for specific details.
Application Process
To apply for a waiver, a J-1 foreign medical graduate must:
Obtain the sponsorship of a state health department, or its equivalent.
Complete the U.S. Department of State (DOS) Form DS-3035, J-1 Visa Waiver Review Application.

The state public health department, or its equivalent, that agreed to sponsor the J-1 foreign medical graduate for a waiver must then send the waiver application to the DOS Waiver Review Division (DOS-WRD) for a recommendation.
For more information regarding DOS filing procedures and documentation requirements, please see Department of State J Visa Waiver.
After DOS Makes a Recommendation
DOS-WRD will notify USCIS electronically of its recommendation. DOS will notify the J-1 foreign medical graduate, attorney of record (if applicable), and the state agency that requested the waiver by mail.
USCIS will make a final determination on whether to approve the waiver application. Upon a favorable recommendation by DOS-WRD, USCIS will generally grant the waiver as long as there are no underlying concerns. USCIS will provide written notice of its decision to the J-1 foreign medical graduate and their representative (if applicable).
If DOS-WRD recommends the waiver:
The petitioner must submit Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, along with the DOS-WRD favorable recommendation letter, in order to request a change of the J-1 foreign medical graduate’s nonimmigrant status to H-1B.
The spouse and/or child of the waiver recipient must submit Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, in order to change status from J-2 to H-4 nonimmigrant status.
The J-1 foreign medical graduate must practice medicine for at least 3 years in an area designated by HHS as a HPSA, MUA, or MUP, or, in some cases, serve patients in such an area.

Once the Conrad 30 waiver recipient has fulfilled all terms and conditions imposed on the waiver, including the 3-year period of employment with the health care facility under their approved contract, they (and their spouse and/or child) will become eligible to apply for:
An immigrant visa
Adjustment of status
An H or L nonimmigrant visa

If the waiver recipient fails to fulfill the terms and conditions imposed on the waiver, they (and their spouse and/or child) will once again become subject to the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the INA.
Frequently Asked Questions
Q1. Does a J-1 foreign medical graduate need to file Form I-612, Application for Waiver of the Foreign Residence Requirement, in order to apply for a Conrad 30 Waiver?
A1. No, the Form I-612 is not required.
Q.2 The law requires the recipient of a Conrad 30 waiver to work full-time for three continuous years. What is the definition of “full-time” work?
A2. DOS considers “full-time” employment to be 40 hours per week.
Q3. If a J-1 foreign medical graduate is granted a Conrad 30 waiver and H-1B status, may he or she change employers if the original health care facility closes?
A3. Depending on the circumstances, USCIS may consider the closure of the health care facility named in the waiver application an extenuating circumstance excusing early termination of employment. A J-1 foreign medical graduate who is granted a Conrad 30 waiver and H-1B status must comply with the terms and conditions of that nonimmigrant status. USCIS may, however excuse early termination of the 3-year period of employment with the health care facility named in the Conrad 30 waiver application and H-1B petition due to extenuating circumstances. Examples of extenuating circumstances include closure of the health care facility or hardship to the noncitizen. In determining whether to excuse such early termination of employment, USCIS will base its decision on the specific facts of each case. In all cases, the burden to establish eligibility for a favorable exercise of discretion rests with the H-1B foreign medical graduate.
Another health care facility may seek to employ such a waiver recipient (before the time the recipient has completed his or her 3-year contract named in the waiver application and the original H-1B petition) by filing a new H-1B petition with USCIS. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(D) and (E). Although the state public health department does not need to file a new waiver application with DOS, the new H-1B petition must be accompanied by the documentary evidence generally required under 8 CFR 214.2(h), including:
An explanation from the waiver recipient, with supporting evidence, establishing that extenuating circumstances necessitate a change of employment
Evidence that the geographic area or areas of intended employment have been designated by HHS as a HPSA, MUA, or MUP, or in some cases, that the waiver recipient will be serving patients in such an area.

The new H-1B petition will not be approved unless USCIS determines that the waiver recipient has established the existence of extenuating circumstances that excuse early termination of employment as stated in the terms and conditions in the original H-1B petition.
Q4. Can the recipient of a Conrad waiver who is in H-1B status begin employment at a new health care facility after the extenuating circumstances H-1B petition is filed and while it is pending?
A4. Yes. The waiver recipient may begin employment with the new employer after the new H-1B petition is filed and while it is pending. However, if the new petition is denied, employment authorization will cease and the waiver recipient will become subject to the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the INA unless they are the beneficiary of another H1-B petition with current validity dates for employment at a qualifying healthcare facility.Q5. What are the reporting requirements for the health care facility named in the waiver application and H-1B petition if the waiver recipient fails to fulfill the 3-year employment contract, or if he or she changes employers?
A5. If the health care facility no longer employs the waiver recipient, the health care facility must immediately send a letter explaining the changes in the terms and conditions of employment of the waiver recipient to the Service Center that approved the I-129 petition, as is required, under 8 CFR 214.2(h)(11)(i)(A).
Q6. Can the spouse and/or child of a waiver recipient who has not yet fulfilled the terms and conditions of the Conrad 30 waiver independently apply for waiver of the 2-year foreign residence requirement?
A6. According to the DOS website, the spouse and/or child of a waiver recipient can independently apply for a waiver only if the principal waiver recipient has died, the spouse has divorced the principal waiver recipient, or if the child is over age 21. Note that if the J-2 spouse/child was also a J-1 at some point in the past, they may, if qualified, seek a waiver for themselves, independent of their spouse/parent.
Q7. How does a Conrad 30 waiver recipient (or some other concerned individual) report wage and labor related abuse?
A7. The Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is responsible for enforcing worker protections in certain temporary worker programs including the H-1B program. For information pertaining to how you can report wage and labor related abuse, please see Department of Labor’s WHD webpage
Background on J-1 medical status
A J-1 exchange visitor who came to the United States or acquired such status in order to receive graduate medical education or training (a J-1 foreign medical graduate) is generally ineligible to apply for:
An immigrant visa
Adjustment of Status
An H or L nonimmigrant visa

To be eligible to do so, a J-1 exchange visitor must have resided and been physically present in his or her country of nationality or last residence for at least 2 years (the 2-year foreign residence requirement) upon completion of the J-1 exchange visitor program. Any spouse or child admitted as an accompanying J-2 status holder is also subject to the 2-year foreign residence requirement. See section 212(e) of the INA.
A J-1 foreign medical graduate (and his or her J-2 spouse and/or child) is ineligible to change from J nonimmigrant status to any other nonimmigrant status (except in certain cases to A, G, T, or U). See section 248(a)(2) of the INA.

Temporary pathways offer opportunities to start and manage a business in the United States for a specified length of time. They do not provide lawful permanent residence, although some people who come to the United States on nonimmigrant visas or parole subsequently transition to permanent resident pathways, and eventually U.S. citizenship. Some of these pathways also permit you to bring your spouse and children under the age of 21 with you to the United States.
International Entrepreneur Rule
Under the International Entrepreneur Rule, DHS may use its parole authority to grant a period of authorized stay, on a case-by-case basis, to noncitizen entrepreneurs who demonstrate that their stay in the United States would provide a significant public benefit through their business venture and that they merit a favorable exercise of discretion. (This period of authorized stay is technically called “parole.”)
What level of ownership and role in the start-up entity is required?
You must have a substantial ownership (which USCIS considers to be at least 10% at time of initial application adjudication) in the start-up business and have a central and active role in its operations.
What are the requirements for the start-up entity?
The start-up must be a U.S. business entity that is lawfully conducting business in the United States and was formed within the five years immediately preceding the application for initial parole. It must also have substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation.
What type and level of funding are required to demonstrate that the start-up entity has the substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation?
You must be able to document that, within the past 18 months, the entity received the following funding:
A qualified investment of at least the required amount from a qualifying investor (currently $264,147);
A qualified award or grant of at least the required amount from a U.S. federal, state, or local government entity (currently $105,659); or
In the alternative, if the start-up entity partially meets one or both of the above funding levels, you may submit additional reliable and compelling evidence of the start-up entity’s substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation.

While you are not precluded from personally investing in the start-up entity or otherwise securing additional funding, only qualified investments from a qualifying investor count towards the minimum investment amount. 
A qualified investor:
Is an individual who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States, or an organization that is located in the United States and operates through a legal entity organized under the laws of the United States or any state, that is majority owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States;
Regularly makes substantial investments in start-up entities that subsequently exhibit substantial growth in terms of revenue generation or job creation; and
During the preceding five years:
	Made investments in start-up entities in exchange for equity, convertible debt, or other security convertible into equity commonly used in financing transactions within their respective industries comprising a total in such five-year period of no less a certain investment amount (currently $633,952); and
Subsequent to such investment by such individual or organization, at least two such entities each created at least five qualified jobs or generated revenue of at least a certain amount (currently $528,293), with average annualized revenue growth of at least 20 percent.


Made investments in start-up entities in exchange for equity, convertible debt, or other security convertible into equity commonly used in financing transactions within their respective industries comprising a total in such five-year period of no less a certain investment amount (currently $633,952); and
Subsequent to such investment by such individual or organization, at least two such entities each created at least five qualified jobs or generated revenue of at least a certain amount (currently $528,293), with average annualized revenue growth of at least 20 percent.

A qualified investor is not:
You or any of your immediate relatives;
An organization in which you or your immediate relatives have a direct or indirect ownership interest;
Permanently or temporarily enjoined from participating in the offer or sale of a security or in the provision of services as an investment adviser, broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, government securities broker, government securities dealer, bank, transfer agent or credit rating agency;
Barred from association with any entity involved in the offer or sale of securities or provision of such services; or
Otherwise found to have participated in the offer or sale of securities or provision of such services in violation of law.

A qualified investment means a purchase from a start-up entity of its equity, convertible debt, or other security convertible into its equity commonly used in financing transactions within such entity's industry.
For information on the qualifying amounts, which adjust every three years for inflation, see updated alerts on International Entrepreneur Parole page.
Can my spouse and children accompany me to the United States?
The spouse and children of an applicant for parole can also apply for parole by filing Form I-131, Application for Travel Document.
Can my spouse work in the United States?
Spouses of noncitizens, after being paroled into the United States under the International Entrepreneur Rule, may apply for employment authorization by filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization.
What is the maximum time I may remain in the United States under the International Entrepreneur Rule?
You may be granted an initial period of stay for up to two-and-a-half years. If approved for re-parole, you may receive up to another two-and-a-half years, for a maximum of five years.
Can I apply from outside the United States?
Yes, as long as you and the start-up entity meet all of the criteria for consideration. If you are an applicant residing outside the United States and seeking an initial period of authorized stay under the International Entrepreneur Rule, you must submit biometrics. We will send you a notice explaining where to submit biometrics after we coordinate with the Department of State (DOS) or the International USCIS field office closest to you.
Can I change to an immigrant or nonimmigrant status?
At any time during the period of authorized stay, you may apply for classification as an immigrant or nonimmigrant, if you are eligible. However, as parole is not admission, you would generally be ineligible for adjustment or change of status and would be required to depart the United States to apply for admission as an immigrant or nonimmigrant, as applicable.
Can I apply if I am in nonimmigrant status, such as B-1 or F-1? Can I apply if I have overstayed the term of my nonimmigrant status, but I believe I fulfill the other criteria?
If you are currently in the United States in nonimmigrant status, you can apply, but you would have to depart the United States to be paroled back in if authorized. If you are not presently maintaining nonimmigrant status you may also apply, but you would have to depart the United States to be paroled back in if authorized. However, a failure to maintain your nonimmigrant status may result in immigration consequences including but not limited to removal, inadmissibility, and being barred from adjustment of status in some categories.
For a more detailed FAQ, see the International Entrepreneur Rule page.
B-1 Temporary Business Visitor
You may be eligible for a B-1 visa if you are coming to the United States as a business visitor in order to secure funding or office space, negotiate a contract, or attend certain business meetings  in connection with and prior to opening and operating a new business in this country.
What is a short period of time?
The B-1 nonimmigrant visa category is not meant for extended, long-term activity, but rather for a definite and specific activity. The maximum period of initial admission to the United States as a B-1 nonimmigrant is typically six months, but the actual period of admission will be for a period which is fair and reasonable for completion of the purpose of the visit (and therefore may be less than six months).  
In no case may the initial period of admission as a B-1 be for more than one year. Extensions of B-1 stay may be available to complete the purpose of your visit to this country. With limited exceptions for certain missionaries, extensions of stay may not be granted in intervals of more than six months each. You must be able to show you have sufficient funds to cover the expenses of the trip and your stay in the United States. You must also show you maintain your residence abroad, which you have no intention of abandoning, and that you have other binding ties which will ensure your return abroad at the end of the visit.
What type of business activities may I engage in?
You may participate in business activities of a commercial or professional nature in the United States including, but not limited to:
Attending meetings;
Consulting with associates;
Engaging in negotiations;
Taking orders for goods produced and located outside the United States; or
Attending conferences, and researching options for opening a business in the United States (such as locating or entering into a lease for office space).

As a B-1 visitor, you cannot engage in any activity or perform a service that would constitute local employment for hire within the United States, that is, work for a U.S. employer while in this country. Further, you may not, for instance, “hang up a shingle,” that is, open and operate your own business in the United States while in B-1 status 
If you are coming to secure funding for a new business, you cannot remain in the United States after securing the funding to start actual operations or to manage the business, unless you change status to another classification that authorizes employment in the United States.
Is any salary permitted?
It is permissible to conduct business activities on behalf of a foreign employer, but no salary may come from a U.S. source. In some cases, however, you may receive reimbursement from a U.S. source for reasonable incidental expenses incurred while in the United States.
Note: There can be no guarantee that the U.S. Department of State (DOS) will issue you a B-1 visa, or that DHS will grant you B-1 status, even if you present the evidence described above.  A consular or DHS officer will consider all the relevant facts before determining whether to issue a visa or grant status.  As such, it is important to fully explain the purpose of your visit or stay and the activities you will be doing, so that DHS (or DOS) can make an informed decision on your application.
E-2 Treaty Investors
You may be eligible for an E-2 visa if you invest a substantial amount of money in a new or existing U.S. business. You must be a national of a country that has a treaty of commerce and navigation with the United States, a country included in another international agreement authorizing E-2 classification, or a country designated by Congress as eligible for participation in the E-2 nonimmigrant visa program. For a list of these countries, visit the Department of State website.
Note:  If your treaty country nationality was obtained through a financial investment, you must show that you were domiciled in the treaty country for three continuous years prior to the time of filing.
What are the requirements for investment in a new or existing enterprise?
USCIS defines an E-2 investment as the investor’s placing of capital, including funds and other assets, at risk in the commercial sense with the objective of generating a profit. Your investment may be for the purpose of establishing a new business venture or purchasing a pre-existing business. In either scenario, you must demonstrate that the capital you are investing is substantial.
A bona fide enterprise is one that is a real, active commercial or entrepreneurial undertaking which produces services or goods for profit. The enterprise cannot be an idle investment held for potential appreciation in value, such as undeveloped land or stocks held by an investor who has no intent to direct the enterprise. Some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate that your business is bona fide includes, but is not limited to:
Notice of assignment of an Employer Identification Number from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS);
Tax returns;
Financial statements;
Quarterly wage reports or payroll summaries (that is, W-2s and W-3);
Business organizational chart;
Business licenses;
Bank statements, utility bills, and advertisements/telephone directory listings;
Contracts or customer/vendor agreements;
Escrow documents; or
Lease agreement.

A marginal enterprise is one that will not generate more than enough income to provide a minimal living for you and your family or to make a significant economic contribution. Some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate that your business is not marginal includes, but is not limited to:
Detailed business plan or executive summary showing that your business will produce more than a minimal living for you and your family or will create a significant economic contribution, along with any evidence that you believe will support the statements in your business plan;
U.S. or foreign individual tax returns;
Financial statements; or
Payroll summaries (that is, W-2s and W-3).

What is required to show I am invested or actively in the process of investing?
You must demonstrate that the capital you invest is irrevocably committed to the enterprise and subject to partial or total loss if the entity fails. The funds you invest must also be your own. Additionally, the invested funds must be substantial in relationship to the total cost of either purchasing an established enterprise or creating the type of enterprise you are considering. Some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate that your investment is substantial and irrevocably committed to the enterprise includes, but is not limited to:
Canceled money orders and/or checks;
Corresponding personal and/or business bank statements;
Itemized list of goods and materials purchased for the start-up;
Corresponding financial accounting documentation;
Lease agreement;
Term Sheet, Letter of Intent, or Memorandum of Understanding;
Bill of sale;

Corresponding forms of payment for stock.

What must I show regarding the source of funds?
You must show a clear and legitimate path regarding the source of the capital you will be investing. You must also demonstrate that the funds you are investing have not been obtained through criminal means. Some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate the source of your capital includes, but is not limited to:
Wire transfers, money orders, and/or canceled checks;
Foreign and domestic bank statements;
Foreign tax returns;
Pay records;
Property records; or
Loan and/or mortgage agreements.

What must I demonstrate my role will be?
You must show that you will develop and direct the investment enterprise by demonstrating ownership of at least 50% of the enterprise, or by possessing operational control through a managerial position or other corporate devices. Some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate your capacity to develop and direct your business venture includes, but is not limited to:
A detailed list of all owners and their percentage of ownership. If you are one of two 50% owners, or own less than 50% of the enterprise, the documentation should be signed by all owners to show that you possess a controlling interest;
Capitalization table;
Stock purchase agreement, term sheet, letter of intent, or memorandum of understanding;
By-laws;
Meeting minutes;
Stock certificates or stock ledger;
Articles of incorporation/organization;
Annual report or U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Form 10-K;
Partnership agreement; or

F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT)
You may be eligible for Optional Practical Training (OPT) if you are an F-1 student in the United States and you seek to start a business that is directly related to your major area of study. Students in English language training programs, however, are ineligible for OPT. In addition, you may not qualify for a Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (STEM) OPT extension if the business is not already established and will be your employer.
Can I start and own my own business?
You may start, own, and work for your own business during your initial period of OPT. However, to qualify for a STEM OPT extension, the start-up entity must be an employer in good standing with E-Verify, sign a training plan for you, and have the resources to comply with the proposed training plan.  While this may not preclude you from having an ownership interest in the start-up, you may not be your own employer and you may not sign the training plan attestation on your own behalf.  DHS has additional information about STEM OPT extensions on DHS Study in the States.
What type of work may I do for the business?
While on F-1 OPT, the work you perform must directly relate to your major area of study.
Can I start and work for a business while I am still in school?
As an F-1 student, you may be authorized up to a total of 12 months of full-time practical training at each educational level (for example, undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate). If you are authorized to engage in pre-completion OPT, you may not work more than 20 hours per week while school is in session but may work full-time during your annual vacation and other times when the school is not in session. If you engage in pre-completion OPT, your eligible period of post-completion OPT when you graduate will be reduced. If you have already received one year of part-time pre-completion OPT, the total time of full-time OPT still available would be reduced by six months, 50% of the previously authorized year at the same education level. In this scenario, you would only be entitled to a remaining period of six months full-time post-completion OPT. If you have already received one year of full-time pre-completion OPT, the total time of full-time OPT still available would be reduced by one year, 100% of the previously authorized year at the same education level. In this scenario, you would not be entitled to any period of post-completion OPT.
Students who graduate with a qualified STEM degree, and are currently in an approved post-completion OPT period based on a designated STEM degree, may apply for a 24-month STEM extension of their post-completion OPT.
How do I apply for F-1 OPT?
Once you receive a recommendation from your Designated School Official (DSO) to pursue OPT, you must apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) with USCIS. For pre-completion OPT, you may apply up to 90 days before you complete a full academic year, if you do not start OPT until you complete one full academic year. For post-completion OPT, you must apply within 30 days after your DSO enters the recommendation into your SEVIS record. Additionally, you may apply up to 90 days prior to your program end date but no later than 60 days after your program end date. 
How do I get a 24-month STEM extension of my post-completion OPT?
If you have completed a qualifying STEM degree, and you are currently in an approved post-completion OPT period based on a designated STEM degree, you may be eligible to apply for a 24-month STEM extension of your post-completion OPT. For a STEM degree to qualify, it must appear on the DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List (January 21, 2022)  (PDF). If you want to apply for a STEM extension, you must apply for the extension with USCIS before your current OPT work authorization expires, but no more than 90 days before the expiration of your OPT. Additionally, you must apply within 60 days after your DSO enters the recommendation into your SEVIS record.
H-1B Specialty Occupation
You may be eligible for classification as an H-1B nonimmigrant if you are planning to work in the United States in an occupation that normally requires a bachelor’s degree or higher in a related field of study (e.g., engineers, scientists, or mathematicians), and you have at least a bachelor’s degree or equivalent in a field related to the position. 
The petitioning employer (the “petitioner”) may be an entity in which you (the “beneficiary”) have an ownership interest.
Below are some key requirements you must fulfill to qualify for classification as an H-1B specialty occupation worker. For each requirement, we have included forms of evidence that you may submit to meet the requirement and other tips to help you prepare your petition. 
Requirement 1 – You must have an employer-employee relationship with the petitioning U.S. employer
In general, an H-1B petitioner may establish a valid employer-employee relationship (PDF, 379.71 KB) with respect to an H-1B beneficiary if the petitioner will hire, pay, fire, supervise, or otherwise control the work of  the beneficiary. The sole or majority owner of the petitioning company or organization may be able to establish a valid employer-employee relationship if the facts show that the petitioning entity meets at least one of the above-listed factors.
How do I demonstrate an employer-employee relationship if I own my own company?
If you own your company, you may be able to demonstrate that an employer-employee relationship (PDF, 379.71 KB) exists if the entity petitioning for your H-1B classification meets at least one of the “hire, pay, fire, supervise, or otherwise control the work of” factors. H-1B petitioners are required to submit a Labor Condition Application (LCA) and a copy of any written contracts between the petitioner and the beneficiary, or a summary of the terms of the oral agreement if a written contract does not exist. Depending upon the content of such documentation, it may establish the employer-employee relationship.  
Requirement 2 – Your job may qualify as a specialty occupation if it meets one of the following criteria:
A bachelor’s or higher degree or its equivalent is normally the minimum requirement for the particular position; 
The degree requirement is common for this position in the industry, or the job is so complex or unique that it can only be performed by someone with at least a bachelor's degree in a field related to the position;
The employer normally requires a degree or its equivalent for the position; or
The nature of the specific duties are so specialized and complex that knowledge required to perform the duties is usually associated with the attainment of a baccalaureate or higher degree. 

Note that “normally,” “common,” and “usually” are interpreted based on their plain language, dictionary definitions. They are not interpreted to mean “always.” 
How do I prove that my position within my business is an occupation that normally requires a degree in a related field?
USCIS often refers to the Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH) from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to help determine whether certain jobs require a degree. If the OOH does not indicate that a degree in a related field is normally the minimum requirement for the position, examples of evidence you may submit to demonstrate that the position normally requires such a degree includes:
Copies of past position announcements, if relevant, that reflect the minimum requirements for the position and which show that your company normally requires a degree for the position and confirming that your position is so specialized or complex it can only be performed by someone with a degree, including a detailed description of the petitioner’s business/products/services and the duties of the position;
A detailed description of the petitioner’s business/products/services and the duties of the position, along with written opinions from experts confirming that your position is so specialized or complex it can only be performed by someone with a degree (in a related field);
Job listings, letters, and/or affidavits from other employers reflecting the minimum requirements for the position and which show that the degree requirement is common to the industry in parallel positions among similar organizations; or
Written opinions from experts in the field explaining how the degree is related to the role you will perform.

Requirement 3 – Your job must be in a specialty occupation related to your field of study
How do I show that my degree is related to the specialty occupation?
Some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate that your degree is related to your position includes:
A detailed explanation of the specific duties of the position, the product or service your company provides, or the complex nature of the role you will perform, and how your degree relates to the role;
Written opinions from experts in the field explaining how the degree is related to the role you will perform;
Resources describing the degree fields normally associated with the occupation; or  
Evidence that similar companies in your industry require similar degrees for similar positions. 

Can I qualify without a bachelor’s degree?
If your position qualifies and you do not have at least a bachelor’s degree in a field related to your position, then you may qualify by:
Holding an unrestricted state license, registration, or certification, which authorizes you to fully practice the specialty occupation and be immediately engaged in that specialty in the state of intended employment; or 
Having education, specialized training, or progressively responsible experience that is equivalent to the completion of a U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree in the specialty occupation and having recognition of expertise in the specialty through progressively responsible positions directly related to the specialty. In general, three years of work experience or training in the field is considered as equivalent to one year of college.  

Note: Submit equivalency documents for all foreign degrees.  If work experience is taken into account, please submit an equivalency evaluation from a college official.  If the equivalency evaluation is not from the registrar, submit a statement from the school’s registrar to establish that the particular evaluating official is authorized to grant college-level credit on behalf of his or her institution.
Requirement 4 – An H-1B visa number must be available at the time of filing the petition, unless the petition is exempt from numerical limits.
The H-1B nonimmigrant classification has an annual numerical limit, or cap, of 65,000 visas or initial status grants each fiscal year. The first 20,000 petitions filed on behalf of beneficiaries who have earned a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. institution of higher education are exempt from the cap. Additionally, H-1B workers who are petitioned for or employed at an institution of higher education (or its affiliated or related nonprofit entities), a nonprofit research organization, or a government research organization are not subject to this numerical cap. 
Cap numbers are often used up very quickly, so it is important to plan ahead if you intend to file an H-1B petition that is subject to the annual H-1B numerical allocations. H-1B cap-subject petitions, including those eligible for the advanced degree exemption, may not be filed unless based on a valid, selected registration for the beneficiary (unless the registration requirement is suspended). Registration typically begins in early March for a start date in the next fiscal year. H-1B petitions can be filed up to six months before the start date.
The USCIS website includes several helpful resources, including on the H-1B cap season, the H-1B electronic registration process, and H-1B petitions in general. 
L-1A Intracompany Transferee
You may be eligible for an L-1 visa for “intracompany transferees” if you are an executive or manager who has worked abroad for a qualifying organization (including an affiliate, parent, subsidiary or branch of your foreign employer) for at least one year within the three years preceding the filing of your L-1 petition (or in some cases your admission to the United States). To qualify for L-1A classification, the organization must seek to transfer you to the United States to work as an executive or manager.
Your foreign employer may transfer you to a U.S. entity that is already doing business or you may be transferred to start a new office. This section will only address new offices. 
A new office is an organization that has been doing business in the United States through a parent, branch, affiliate, or subsidiary for less than one year. Because the term organization in the definition of new office is not separately defined, it can be either a U.S. or foreign corporation or other legal entity. The requisite less than one year limitation applies to the new offices that meet any of the four individual entity types – parent, branch, subsidiary, or affiliate. The regulations define a branch as “an operating division or office of the same organization housed in a different location,” illustrating that the organization is not limited to only one location in the United States. Among the factors to be considered are the amount of investment, intended personnel structure, product or service to be provided, physical premises, and viability of the foreign operation.
For more information about L-1A intracompany transferees and the differences between the requirements for established offices and new offices, see L-1A Intracompany Transferee and the USCIS Policy Manual.
Requirement 1 - The U.S. entity must have a qualifying relationship with your foreign employer.
The U.S. entity must have a corporate relationship with the foreign entity where you have been employed as a manager or executive. This means that the U.S. entity must be a parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or branch of the foreign entity, and that both the U.S. entity and the foreign entity must continue to share common ownership and control. You may still qualify, however, even if the specific foreign entity where you worked abroad for the requisite one year is no longer in operation, provided that there continues to exist at least one other qualifying foreign entity remaining in operation during your entire period of stay in the United States as an L-1A nonimmigrant executive or manager.
How do I demonstrate that the new office in the United States has a qualifying relationship with my foreign employer?
Some of the evidence you may submit to show that the new U.S. business has the requisite qualifying relationship to your foreign employer includes, but is not limited to:
Articles of incorporation or similar organizational documents showing common ownership of the U.S. and foreign entities;
Bylaws or similar operating documents evidencing common ownership of the U.S. and foreign entities;
Organizational charts illustrating the qualifying relationship between the U.S. and foreign entities;
Business registration records, meeting minutes, ownership certificates, or ownership ledgers demonstrating common ownership and control of the U.S. and foreign entities;
Bank statements or wire transfer documents demonstrating capital contribution in exchange for ownership;
Annual reports describing the corporate structure;
Corporate filings in the United States or abroad describing the corporate relationship; and
Any other evidence demonstrating ownership and control over the U.S. and foreign entities (that is, stock purchase agreements, voting rights agreements, capitalization tables, term sheets).

Notes:
1) If the U.S. entity is an affiliate, provide a detailed list of the owners of the foreign and U.S. companies, including the percentage of ownership, along with supporting documentation. An affiliate is defined as one of two subsidiaries owned and controlled by the same parent or individual, or the same group of individuals, each owning and controlling the same share or proportion of each entity.
2) If the U.S. entity is a parent or subsidiary, provide a detailed list of the owners, including the percentage of ownership, along with supporting documentation.  A subsidiary is an entity of which a parent:
Owns, directly or indirectly, more than half the entity and controls the entity;
Owns, directly or indirectly, half the entity and controls the entity;
Owns, directly or indirectly, 50% of a 50-50 joint venture and has equal control and veto power over the entity; or
Owns, directly or indirectly, less than half of the entity, but in fact controls the entity.

3) A branch is an operating division or office of the same organization housed in a different location. Probative evidence that the U.S. employer is a branch office may include but is not limited to one or more of the following:
A state or territorial business license establishing that the foreign corporation is authorized to engage in business activities in the United States;
Copies of the U.S. Income Tax Return of a Foreign Corporation (IRS Form 1120-F);
Copies of the Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return (IRS Form 941) listing the branch office as the employer;
Copies of the Wage and Tax Statement (IRS Form W-2) listing the branch office as the employer; or
Copies of a lease for office space in the United States.

If the petitioner seeks to transfer the beneficiary from a foreign branch office, the petition should include comparable evidence to establish that the foreign employer is a branch office of a qualifying entity.
How do I demonstrate that I have worked the required amount of time abroad?
Some of the evidence you may submit to document your foreign employment for one out of the last three years includes, but is not limited to:
Pay stubs;
Payroll records; and
Tax returns that show employment.

How do I show that my foreign employment was in a qualifying capacity?
Some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate that your foreign employment was in a managerial or executive capacity includes:
Organizational charts showing your position and any employees that support your position;
Performance appraisals or reviews; and
Job descriptions for your position and those positions that report above and/or below you, if applicable.

Requirement 2 - Sufficient physical space must be secured for a new office.
While the amount of physical space may vary depending on the nature of the business, an appropriate physical space to conduct the proposed business must be secured through lease, purchase, or other means.  
How do I prove that the new U.S. office has sufficient space to do business?
When filing for the purpose of opening a new office in the United States, some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate sufficient physical space for the new U.S. office to do business includes, but is not limited to:
Signed lease agreement;
Mortgages or other proof of real estate purchase; and
Business plan, marketing materials, or other descriptions of the business connecting the activity of the business with the space acquired.

Notes:
1) If you are filing for a new office, provide a copy of a business plan or executive summary that shows the size of the U.S. investment and your ability to commence doing business in the United States.
2) In addition to evidence showing you have secured a physical premise, explain how this location is sufficient for your business.
Requirement 3 - A new office must be active and operating within one year after your admission as an L-1 to the United States in order to extend your stay.
The “new office” L-1 visa is meant to facilitate a “ramp up” period for a new U.S. office of a foreign entity. This period is limited to one year. After that time, an extension of the L-1 visa is available if the new office meets this requirement of being active and operating. What makes an office active and operating will differ depending on the nature of the business. Typically, it will involve factors such as, but not limited to, hiring additional employees, fulfillment of contract orders, having a revenue stream, or holding inventory, if applicable.
Requirement 4 - After one year, the new office must support a managerial or executive position if you are requesting an extension of stay in the L-1A classification.
During the first-year ramp up, a manager or executive may be required, as a practical matter, to engage in many “hands-on” tasks that go beyond inherently managerial or executive tasks. After the first year, however, you will be required to focus primarily on managerial or executive tasks and demonstrate that the business now supports a managerial or executive position in order to obtain an extension of the L-1 visa.   
After one year, how do I demonstrate that the new office is fully functioning and that it will support my role as a manager or executive?
Some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate that the new office is fully functioning includes, but is not limited to:
Purchase orders, contracts or other evidence of commercial activity;
Organizational charts identifying your position and current employees supporting your position;
Quarterly wage reports showing current staff and employees hired;
Bank statements;
Financial reporting documents showing monthly income; and
Position descriptions providing the roles and responsibilities of all current employees, or other evidence which clearly demonstrates how your managerial or executive position is relieved of primarily performing non-qualifying duties.

O-1 Extraordinary Ability
You may be eligible for classification as an O-1A nonimmigrant if you have extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics, which can be demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim and recognition, and you will be coming to the United States to work in your field of expertise, which may include working for a business that you own. Extraordinary ability means you have a level of expertise indicating you are one of the small percentage of people who have risen to the very top of your field.
Requirement 1 – A U.S. employer or U.S. agent must file the petition.
USCIS regulations provide that the petitioner may be either a U.S. employer or U.S. agent (who may be the actual employer of the beneficiary, the representative of both the employer and the beneficiary; or a person or entity authorized by the employer to act for, or in place of, the employer as its agent). While O-1 beneficiaries may not self-petition, a separate legal entity you own (such as a corporation or limited liability company) may file a petition on your behalf.
Requirement 2 - You must be able to establish that you have extraordinary ability in your field.  
The O-1A classification, for those in the sciences, business, education, or athletics, is for people who are among a small percentage at the very top of their field and who are coming to the United States to continue work in that field of expertise. 
To establish eligibility for classification as an O-1A nonimmigrant, you must provide initial evidence that you either have received a major, internationally recognized award, or submit initial evidence that satisfies at least three of the eight evidentiary criteria.
The USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance regarding how O-1A eligibility is evaluated, including a chart (reproduced below) that describes relevant examples of evidence that may satisfy each of the alternate O-1A evidentiary requirements, as well as considerations that are relevant to evaluating such evidence.
Examples:
Awards from well-known national institutions and well-known professional associations.
Certain doctoral dissertation awards and Ph.D. scholarships.
Certain awards recognizing presentations at nationally or internationally recognized conferences.

 Considerations:
 While many scholastic awards do not have the requisite level of recognition, there are some Ph.D. scholarships or dissertation awards, for example, that are nationally or internationally recognized as awards for excellence such that they may satisfy the requirements of this criterion. Relevant considerations include, but are not limited to: 
The criteria use to grant the awards or prizes;
The national or international significance of the awards or prizes in the field;
The number of awardees or prize recipients; and
Limitations on eligible competitors.

For example, an award available only to persons within a single locality, employer, or school may have little national or international recognition, while an award open to members of a well-known national institution (including an R1 or R2 doctoral university) or professional organization may be nationally recognized.
Examples:
Membership in certain professional associations.
Fellowships with certain organizations or institutions.

Considerations:
The petitioner must show that membership in the association requires outstanding achievements in the field for which classification is sought, as judged by recognized national or international experts. 
Associations may have multiple levels of membership. The petitioner must show that to obtain the level of membership afforded to the beneficiary, the beneficiary was judged by recognized national or international experts as having attained outstanding achievements in the field for which classification is sought. 
As a possible example, membership in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) at the IEEE fellow level requires, in part, that a nominee have “accomplishments that have contributed importantly to the advancement or application of engineering, science and technology, bringing the realization of significant value to society,” and nominations are judged by an IEEE council of experts and a committee of current IEEE fellows. As another possible example, membership as a fellow in the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) is based on recognition of a nominee’s “significant, sustained contributions” to the field of artificial intelligence, and is judged by a panel of current AAAI fellows.
Relevant factors that may lead an officer to a conclusion that the person's membership in one or more associations was not based on outstanding achievements in the field include, but are not limited to, instances where the person's membership was based:
Solely on a level of education or years of experience in a particular field;
On the payment of a fee or by subscribing to an association's publications; or
On a requirement, compulsory or otherwise, for employment in certain occupations, such as union membership.

Examples:
Professional or major print publications (newspaper articles, popular and academic journal articles, books, textbooks, or similar publications) regarding the beneficiary and the beneficiary’s work.
Professional or major online publications regarding the beneficiary and the beneficiary’s work.
Transcript of professional or major audio or video coverage of the beneficiary and the beneficiary’s work.

Considerations:
Published material that includes only a brief citation or passing reference to the beneficiary’s work is not “about” the beneficiary, relating to the beneficiary’s work in the field, as required under this criterion. However, the beneficiary and the beneficiary’s work need not be the only subject of the material; published material that covers a broader topic but includes a substantial discussion of the beneficiary’s work in the field and mentions the beneficiary in connection to the work may be considered material “about” the beneficiary relating to their work. 
Moreover, officers may consider material that focuses solely or primarily on work or research being undertaken by a team of which the beneficiary is a member, provided that the material mentions the beneficiary in connection with the work, or other evidence in the record documents the beneficiary’s significant role in the work or research.
In evaluating whether a submitted publication is a professional publication, major trade publication, or major media, relevant factors include the intended audience (for professional and major trade publications) and the relative circulation, readership, or viewership (for major trade publications and other major media).
Examples:
Reviewer of abstracts or papers submitted for presentation at scholarly conferences in the respective field.
Peer reviewer for scholarly publications.
Member of doctoral dissertation committees.
Peer reviewer for government research funding programs.

Considerations:
The petitioner must show that the beneficiary has not only been invited to judge the work of others, but also that the beneficiary actually participated in the judging of the work of others in the same or allied field of specialization. 
For example, a petitioner might document a beneficiary’s peer review work by submitting a copy of a request from a journal to the beneficiary to do the review, accompanied by evidence confirming that the beneficiary completed the review.
Examples:
Published materials about the significance of the beneficiary’s original work.
Testimonials, letters, and affidavits about the beneficiary’s original work.
Documentation that the beneficiary’s original work was cited at a level indicative of major significance in the field.
Patents or licenses deriving from the beneficiary’s work or evidence of commercial use of the beneficiary’s work.

Considerations:
Analysis under this criterion focuses on whether the beneficiary’s original work constitutes major, significant contributions to the field. 
Evidence that the beneficiary’s work was funded, patented, or published, while potentially demonstrating the work’s originality, will not necessarily establish, on its own, that the work is of major significance to the field. However, published research that has provoked widespread commentary on its importance from others working in the field, and documentation that it has been highly cited relative to other works in that field, may be probative of the significance of the beneficiary’s contributions to the field of endeavor. 
Similarly, evidence that the beneficiary developed a patented technology that has attracted significant attention or commercialization may establish the significance of the beneficiary’s original contribution to the field. If a patent remains pending, USCIS will likely require additional supporting evidence to document the originality of the beneficiary’s contribution.
Detailed letters from experts in the field explaining the nature and significance of the beneficiary’s contribution(s) may also provide valuable context for evaluating the claimed original contributions of major significance, particularly when the record includes documentation corroborating the claimed significance. 
Submitted letters should specifically describe the beneficiary’s contribution and its significance to the field and should also set forth the basis of the writer’s knowledge and expertise.
Examples:
Publications in professionally-relevant journals.
Published conference presentations at nationally or internationally recognized conferences.

Considerations:
To meet this criterion, the beneficiary must be a listed author of the submitted article(s) but need not be the sole or first author. In addition, a petitioner need not provide evidence that the beneficiary’s published work has been cited to meet this criterion.
In addition, the articles must be scholarly. In the academic arena, a scholarly article reports on original research, experimentation, or philosophical discourse. It is written by a researcher or expert in the field who is often affiliated with a college, university, or research institution and the article is normally peer-reviewed. 
In general, it should have footnotes, endnotes, or a bibliography, and may include graphs, charts, videos, or pictures as illustrations of the concepts expressed in the article. In non-academic arenas, a scholarly article should be written for learned persons in that field.
In evaluating whether a submitted publication is a professional publication, major trade publication, or major media, relevant factors include the intended audience (for professional and major trade publications) and the circulation, readership, or viewership relative to other media in the field (for major trade publications and other major media).
Examples:
Senior faculty or senior research position for a distinguished academic department or program.
Senior research position for a distinguished non-academic institution or company.
Principal or named investigator for a department, institution, or business that received a merit-based government award, such as an academic research or Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant.
Member of a key committee within a distinguished organization.
Founder or co-founder of, or contributor of intellectual property to, a start-up business that has a distinguished reputation.
Critical or essential supporting role for a distinguished organization or a distinguished division of an institution or company, as explained in detail by the director or a principal investigator of the relevant organization or division.

Considerations:
To show a critical role, the evidence should establish that the beneficiary has contributed in a way that is significant to the organization or establishment’s activities. To show an essential role, the evidence should establish that the beneficiary’s role is (or was) integral to the entity. A leadership role in an organization often qualifies as critical or essential. 
For a supporting role to be considered critical or essential, USCIS considers other factors, such as whether the beneficiary’s performance in the role is (or was) integral or important to the organization or establishment’s goals or activities, especially in relation to others in similar positions within the organization. 
It is not the title of the beneficiary’s role, but rather the beneficiary’s duties and performance in the role that determines whether the role is (or was) critical or essential. Detailed letters from persons with personal knowledge of the significance of the beneficiary’s role can be particularly helpful in analyzing this criterion. The organization need not have directly employed the beneficiary.
In addition, the organization or establishment must be recognized as having a distinguished reputation. Relevant factors for evaluating the reputation of an organization or establishment can include the scale of its customer base, longevity, or relevant media coverage. 
For academic departments, programs, and institutions, officers may also consider national rankings and receipt of government research grants as positive factors in some cases. 
For a start-up business, officers may consider evidence that the business has received significant funding from government entities, venture capital funds, angel investors, or other such funders commensurate with funding rounds generally achieved for that start-up’s stage and industry, as a positive factor regarding its distinguished reputation.
Examples:
Tax returns, pay statements, or other evidence of past salary or remuneration for services.
Contract, job offer letter, or other evidence of prospective salary or remuneration for services.
Comparative wage or remuneration data for the beneficiary’s field, such as geographical or position-appropriate compensation surveys.

Considerations:
If the petitioner is claiming to meet this criterion, then the burden is on the petitioner to provide appropriate evidence establishing that the beneficiary’s compensation is high relative to others working in similar occupations in the field. The following webpages, among others, may be helpful in evaluating the relative compensation for a given field:
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Overview of BLS Wage Data by Area and Occupation webpage; and
The Department of Labor's Career One Stop webpage.

Officers should evaluate persons working outside of the United States based on the wage statistics or comparable evidence for that locality, rather than by simply converting the salary to U.S. dollars and then viewing whether that salary would be considered high in the United States.
For entrepreneurs or founders of start-up businesses, officers consider evidence that the business has received significant funding from government entities, venture capital funds, angel investors, or other such funders in evaluating the credibility of submitted contracts, job offer letters, or other evidence of prospective salary or remuneration for services.
Note: If any of the criteria discussed in the Appendix chart do not readily apply to your occupation, the petitioner may submit comparable evidence to establish your eligibility. When the required initial evidence has been provided, USCIS will evaluate the totality of the evidence to determine eligibility.
The Policy Manual also includes guidance regarding the use of comparable evidence to establish eligibility, as well as the guidance regarding how USCIS evaluates the totality of the evidence for O-1A petitions.
Requirement 3 – You must show that you will continue to work in your area of expertise.
You are required to provide copies of any written contracts between you and the petitioner/start-up entity. If there is no written contract, you may provide a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which you will be employed. In addition, you must provide an explanation of the nature of the events or activities, which may include your employment, in the United States.
Requirement 4 – You must obtain an advisory opinion from an appropriate peer group.
The advisory opinion must be written by an individual or group with expertise in your field regarding the nature of your work and your qualifications. The consultation should describe your ability and achievements in your field."
Optional Practical Training (OPT) for F-1 Students,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/optional-practical-training-opt-for-f-1-students,"
Optional Practical Training (OPT) is temporary employment that is directly related to an F-1 student’s major area of study. Eligible students can apply to receive up to 12 months of OPT employment authorization before completing their academic studies (pre-completion) and/or after completing their academic studies (post-completion). However, all periods of pre-completion OPT will be deducted from the available period of post-completion OPT.
All OPT must be directly related to your major area of study. If you are an F-1 student, you may be eligible to participate in OPT in two different ways:
Pre-completion OPT: You may apply to participate in pre-completion OPT after you have been lawfully enrolled on a full-time basis for one full academic year at a college, university, conservatory, or seminary that has been certified by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) to enroll F-1 students. You do not need to have had F-1 status for the one full academic year; you can satisfy the “one full academic year” requirement even if you had another nonimmigrant status during that time.

If you are authorized to participate in pre-completion OPT, you may work (20 hours or less per week) while school is in session. You may work full time when school is not in session.
Post-completion OPT: You may apply to participate in post-completion OPT after completing your studies. If you are authorized for post-completion OPT, you must work part time (at least 20 hours per week) or full time.

Impact of Pre-completion OPT Employment Authorization on Requests for Post-completion OPT at the Same Education Level
If you have already received 1 year of part-time (20 hours per week) pre-completion OPT, the total time of full-time OPT still available would be reduced by 6 months, 50% of the previously authorized year at the same education level. In this scenario, you would only be entitled to a remaining period of 6 months full-time post-completion OPT employment authorization.
If you have already received 1 year of full-time (40 hours per week) pre-completion OPT, the total time of full-time optional practical training still available would be reduced by 1 year, 100% of the previously authorized year at the same education level. In this scenario, you would not be entitled to any period of post-completion OPT employment authorization.
If you have earned a degree in certain science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields, you may apply for a 24-month extension of your post-completion OPT employment authorization if you:
Are an F-1 student who received a STEM degree included on the STEM Designated Degree Program List   (PDF);
Are employed by an employer who is enrolled in and is using E-Verify; and
Received an initial grant of post-completion OPT employment authorization based on your STEM degree.

If you are interested in applying for a STEM OPT extension, please see our Optional Practical Training Extension for STEM Students (STEM OPT) page for more information.
Generally, you must:
If you are applying based on a…
For…
Then you…
STEM degree
Pre-completion OPT
Must apply after your DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record, and
May apply up to 90 days before you complete a full academic year, as long as you do not start OPT employment until you complete one full academic year.

Initial post-completion OPT
Must apply after your DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record, and
Must apply within 30 days after your DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record, and
May apply up to 90 days before you complete your degree, but no later than 60 days after you complete your degree.

 
STEM OPT extension
Must apply after your DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record, and
Must apply within 60 days after your DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record, and
May apply up to 90 days before your current OPT employment authorization expires.

Non-STEM degree
Pre-completion OPT
Must apply after your DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record, and
May apply up to 90 days before you complete a full academic year, as long as you do not start OPT employment until you complete one full academic year.

Post-completion OPT
Must apply after your DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record, and
Must apply within 30 days after your DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record, and
May apply up to 90 days before you complete your degree, but no later than 60 days after you complete your degree.

You may begin your pre- or post-completion OPT only after we approve your Form I-765 and you receive your Employment Authorization Document (EAD).
If you file your STEM OPT extension application on time and your OPT period expires while your extension application is pending, we will automatically extend your employment authorization for 180 days. This automatic 180-day extension ceases once USCIS adjudicates your STEM OPT extension application.
If you transfer to another school or begin studies at another educational level (for example, you completed a bachelor’s degree and are starting a master’s program), your authorization to engage in OPT employment will automatically terminate. SEVP will inform USCIS of the termination date, and USCIS will terminate your EAD accordingly. 
Although your authorization to engage in optional practical training will end, as long as you comply with all requirements for maintaining your student status, your F-1 status will not be affected by USCIS terminating your EAD. Maintaining your student status includes not working on a terminated EAD, as the termination means that you are no longer authorized to work in the United States using that OPT EAD. Working in the United States without authorization has serious consequences, including removal from the country and reentry bars. Also, remaining in the United States in violation of your lawful nonimmigrant status could lead to an accrual of unlawful presence. Please see USCIS Changing Policy on Accrued Unlawful Presence by Nonimmigrant Students and Exchange Visitors for more information regarding termination of your employment authorization under OPT and any impacts on your student status, including the possible accrual of unlawful presence.
If you feel that your EAD has been wrongfully terminated, would like to request reconsideration of the EAD termination, or if you have other questions, see your DSO. 
If you are an F-1 student with a timely filed H-1B petition and change of status request, and your F-1 status and employment authorization will expire before the change of status to H-1B occurs (typically Oct. 1), you may be eligible for a cap-gap extension. Go to our Cap-Gap Extension page for more information."
Immigrant Pathways for Entrepreneur Employment in the United States,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/entrepreneur-employment-pathways/immigrant-pathways-for-entrepreneur-employment-in-the-united-states,"
Immigrant pathways offer opportunities to work in the United States for a range of reasons on a more permanent basis. They provide lawful permanent residence (Green Card) which can eventually lead to U.S. citizenship.

The lawful permanent resident process involves at least two steps, depending on the employment-based immigrant visa classification sought.  An immigrant petition must be filed with USCIS and then, if you are in the United States and eligible, you may file an adjustment of status application with USCIS without departing the United States, or you may file an immigrant visa application with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) outside the United States and go through consular processing.

An approved immigrant visa petition secures your priority date that will determine the order of immigrant visa availability. Your priority date is generally the date the immigrant visa petition was filed on your behalf. You may only file an adjustment of status application, or request a visa through a consulate, once an immigrant visa is immediately available. If an immigrant visa is immediately available when you or your sponsoring employer files the immigrant petition with USCIS, you may file your adjustment application at the same time. You are eligible to apply for employment authorization concurrently with your adjustment application and while your adjustment application is pending.

The availability of an immigrant visa will depend on the employment-based classification being sought and the immigrant’s country of chargeability (usually the country of birth).

The USCIS webpages on Visa Availability and Priority Dates and Consular Processing provide information about the DOS Visa Bulletin process and explain how DOS allocates immigrant visas and consular processing generally.

EB-1A – Extraordinary Ability
  
You may be eligible for the EB-1A extraordinary ability immigrant classification if you have extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics as demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim and recognized achievements in the field of expertise. In addition, you must show that you will continue working in your area of extraordinary ability and that your work will substantially benefit the United States in the future. Extraordinary ability means that your level of expertise indicates that you are one of the small percentage of individuals who have risen to the very top of your field. You may self-petition as an extraordinary ability individual, because a job offer is not required for this classification.
    
Requirement 1- You must be able to establish that you have extraordinary ability in your field.

The EB-1A extraordinary ability classification is for people who are recognized as being at the very top of their field and who are coming to (or remaining in) the United States to continue work in that field. To establish eligibility, you must demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and that your achievements have been recognized in the field of expertise by showing that you:
    
Have received a major internationally recognized award; or
Meet at least three of the 10 requirements listed below and all your evidence, when evaluated together, shows that you are among the small percentage of individuals that have risen to the very top of your field.

If you have not received a major internationally recognized award, you must answer yes and submit evidence for at least three of the 10 questions below:
    
Have you received any lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor?
Are you a member of associations that require outstanding achievements of their members as judged by recognized national or international experts?
Is there published material in professional or major trade publications or major media about you which relates to your work in the field?
Have you participated on a panel or individually as a judge of the work of others in the same or in an allied field of specialization?
Have you made original scientific, scholarly or business contributions that are of major significance?
Have you authored scholarly articles in professional journals or other major media?
Has your work been displayed at artistic exhibitions or showcases?
Have you played a leading or critical role for an organization with a distinguished reputation?
Have you or will you command a high salary or other remuneration for your services in comparison to others in your field?
Have you enjoyed commercial successes in the performing arts?

Note: If the criteria discussed in this section do not readily apply to your occupation, you may submit comparable evidence to establish your eligibility. However, there is no comparable evidence for the one-time achievement of a major, internationally recognized award.
    
If you meet these minimum threshold requirements, USCIS will then evaluate all the evidence you submitted in its totality to determine whether you have sustained national or international acclaim and recognized achievements in your field of expertise and that you are one of the small percentage of individuals who have risen to the very top of your field.
    
The USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance regarding how EB-1A eligibility is evaluated, including an appendix chart that describes considerations that are relevant to evaluating evidence under each of the above criteria and evaluating comparable evidence.
    
Requirement 2 – You must be able to establish that you are coming to (or remaining in) the United States to continue to work in your area of extraordinary ability and your entry will substantially benefit the United States.

Some of the evidence you may submit to meet this requirement includes, but is not limited to:
    
Letters from current or prospective employers;
Documents evidencing your prearranged commitments (e.g. contracts); and
A statement detailing your plans on how you intend to continue working in your field in the United States.

EB-2 Employment-Based Second Preference with National Interest Waiver (NIW) - Exceptional ability or advanced degree professional with NIW
  
The EB-2 immigrant visa category is for noncitizens who are either professionals with advanced degrees or individuals with exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business. This category generally requires a job offer and a labor certification issued by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) before an employer could move on to the next step of filing an immigrant visa petition with USCIS and (if approved) before a beneficiary could be issued an immigrant visa through adjustment or consular processing. Please visit DOL’s website to learn more about the labor certification process.
    
DOL regulations generally prohibit the issuance of labor certifications in self-employment scenarios. However, an entrepreneur seeking EB-2 classification and a National Interest Waiver (NIW) may self-petition and not be subject to the labor certification requirement. Accordingly, one option for entrepreneurs includes filing an EB-2 visa petition if they can qualify for an NIW, which exempts them from the job offer requirement and, thus, the labor certification requirement.
    
If you are requesting a NIW, you must first demonstrate that you are either a member of the professions holding an advanced degree or an individual of exceptional ability.
    
Advanced Degree Professionals

Requirement 1 – You must show that you have a U.S. advanced degree or foreign equivalent degree.

An ""advanced degree” is an academic or professional degree above a bachelor’s degree.  Some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate that you have an advanced degree may include:
    
Copies of official transcripts;
Certified copies of the actual degree, diploma, certificate, or similar award;
Any other official documentation from the school’s Office of the Registrar;
An evaluation from an educational evaluation agency, if you obtained your degree outside the United States; and
If you only have a U.S. bachelor’s degree (or foreign equivalent degree), letters from your current and/or prior employers showing at least 5 years of progressively responsible experience in your field after you received the degree.

The USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance on how we determine eligibility for advanced degree professionals.
    
Requirement 2 – Your advanced degree must be related to the field in which you will be working.

Some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate that your advanced degree relates to your field includes, but is not limited to:
    
A letter from you or your prospective employer describing your current or proposed job;
Documents describing your company and its work; and
A copy of your company’s annual report, if one is issued.

Exceptional Ability

Requirement 1 – You must show that you have exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business.

To qualify for the EB-2 exceptional ability classification, you must show that you have exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business. The initial evidence must include at least three of the six types of evidence listed below. If you meet the minimum threshold requirements, USCIS will then evaluate all the evidence you submitted in its totality to determine whether you have a degree of expertise significantly above that normally encountered in the sciences, arts, or business. You must answer yes and submit evidence for at least three of the six questions below:
    
Have you received a degree, diploma, certificate or similar award from a college, university, school or other institution, relating to the field of exceptional ability?
Do you have at least 10 years of full-time experience in your field?
If required, do you have a license or certification to practice in your profession or occupation?
Have you or will you command a high salary or other remuneration for your services, which demonstrates your exceptional ability?
Are you a member of professional associations?
Have you been recognized for achievements and significant contributions to your industry or field?

Note: If any of the criteria discussed in this section do not readily apply to your occupation, you may submit comparable evidence to establish your eligibility.
    
If you meet these minimum threshold requirements, USCIS will then evaluate all the evidence you submitted in its totality to determine whether you have a degree of expertise significantly above that normally encountered in the sciences, arts, or business.
    
The USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance on how we determine eligibility for exceptional ability classification.
    
Requirement 2 – You must show that you will substantially benefit prospectively the U.S. economy, U.S. cultural interests, U.S. educational interests, or U.S. welfare.

A prospective benefit is generally shown by documenting a past record of achievements and explaining how that indicates your future success.
    
Some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate how you will substantially benefit the United States prospectively includes, but is not limited to:
    
Documents showing how your past accomplishments benefit the United States as a whole and specifying which element(s) (national economy, cultural or educational interest, or welfare of the United States) your entrepreneurial enterprise will benefit;
Copies of awards or any special recognition you may have received, with details about the criteria used to grant the award or recognition;
Published reports about your successes;
Letters from current or former employers documenting your prior work experience, to include information about your accomplishments and their significance, and how these accomplishments benefit the United States;
Letters from experts in your field regarding your accomplishments and their significance, including how your work will prospectively benefit the United States; and
Evidence of past achievements should be accompanied with documentation or explanations of how these accomplishments indicate future or continued success.

National Interest Waiver

USCIS may, as a matter of discretion, grant your request for a National Interest Waiver where the below requirements are met:
    
Your proposed endeavor has both substantial merit and national importance.
You are well-positioned to advance the proposed endeavor.
On balance, it would be beneficial to the United States to waive the requirements of a job offer, and thus the labor certification.

The USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance on how we evaluate eligibility for national interest waivers based on the above requirements, and it also includes a discussion of specific evidentiary considerations for entrepreneurs. For example, there may be unique aspects of evidence submitted by an entrepreneurial petitioner undertaking a proposed endeavor, including through an entity based in the United States in which the petitioner typically possesses (or will possess) an ownership interest, and in which the petitioner maintains (or will maintain) an active and central role such that the petitioner’s knowledge, skills, or experience would significantly advance the proposed endeavor.
    
USCIS considers that entrepreneurs do not follow traditional career paths and start-ups vary in structure. In addition to the general guidance, the USCIS Policy Manual clarifies that as an entrepreneur petitioner, you may submit other types of evidence to establish that your endeavor has substantial merit and national importance, that you are well positioned to advance the endeavor, and that, on balance, it would be beneficial to waive the job offer and thus labor certification requirements.
    
EB-5 – Immigrant Investor Program
  
Congress created the EB-5 program to stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors. This section will focus on entrepreneurs investing in their own businesses. For information on investors pooling their investments through the Regional Center Program, see About the EB-5 Visa Classification. 
    
What investment is required?

You must invest in a new commercial enterprise established after Nov. 29, 1990. You must invest $1.05 million unless the enterprise is doing business in a targeted employment area, which is one that has a high unemployment rate or is in a rural area. In that case the minimum investment is $800,000. You must establish the lawful source of your invested capital.
    
What job creation is required?

You must establish that the new commercial enterprise will create full-time positions for at least 10 qualifying employees.
    
Are there any requirements after I become a permanent resident?

Immigrant investors are admitted as lawful permanent residents on a conditional basis. Within ninety days before the two-year anniversary of obtaining conditional lawful permanent resident status, you must apply to remove the conditions on your status. For more information on removing conditions, see EB-5 Immigrant Investor Process.

Options for Noncitizen Entrepreneurs to Work in the United States,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/options-for-noncitizen-entrepreneurs-to-work-in-the-united-states,"
The United States has long been a destination for top talent from all over the world. Our ability to attract entrepreneurs has spurred path-breaking innovation, leading to the creation of jobs, new industries, and new opportunities for all Americans.
This online resource provides an overview of some of the temporary and permanent pathways for noncitizen entrepreneurs to work in the United States. This guide also highlights some of the most important immigration-related considerations for entrepreneurs contemplating starting or managing a business in the United States.
More information is available on uscis.gov for temporary and permanent pathways as well as for the International Entrepreneur Rule and Optional Practical Training (OPT) for F-1 students. In addition, the Working in the United States section of uscis.gov provides a general guide to employment in the United States. You may wish to consult with an attorney to determine the best option for you.
Key Questions to Consider When Choosing an Entrepreneur Pathway
Am I required to make an investment or have an ownership interest in the start-up?
Some pathways, such as the International Entrepreneur Rule, require you to have a certain amount of ownership in the start-up entity. Other pathways, such as E-2 Treaty Investor or EB-5 Immigrant Investor, require you invest. For some pathways, you may be an owner or investor, but it is not required.
Am I required to have a certain role or position in the start-up entity?
Some pathways require that you have a certain role or position in the start-up entity. The International Entrepreneur Rule requires you to have a central and active role in operations. E-2 requires you to have the capacity to develop and direct the enterprise. L-1A Intracompany Transferee Executive or Manager requires you to be in a managerial or executive position. H-1B Specialty Occupation requires you to work in a specialty occupation related to your degree. Other pathways, such as the O-1A nonimmigrant classification or the EB-1A first-preference immigrant visa classification, are for individuals with extraordinary ability and require you to continue to work in your field of expertise. Additional pathways are discussed in detail below.
What are the requirements for the start-up entity?
Some pathways have requirements for the start-up entity. For example, the International Entrepreneur Rule requires the entity to lawfully conduct business in the United States and to have been formed within the five years immediately preceding the initial application. It must also have substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation. The L-1 nonimmigrant visa classification requires the new office to have a qualifying relationship (parent, subsidiary, or affiliate) with a foreign business that employed you abroad for at least one year. Additional requirements are discussed in detail below.
Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?
Some pathways, such as the O-1A nonimmigrant visa classification and the EB-1A immigrant visa classification, are for those with “extraordinary ability.” These require that a person have sustained national or international acclaim in their field of expertise. Others, such as the H-1B, require at least a U.S. bachelor’s degree in a specific specialty or its equivalent related to the position.
Will I be working in the United States on a permanent basis as a lawful permanent resident, or will I be working on a temporary basis as a parolee or nonimmigrant?
Some opportunities provide a basis for individuals to obtain lawful permanent resident status in the United States. Permanent resident status allows you to live and work in the United States permanently, and typically provides you with a path to U.S. citizenship. These opportunities are known as “immigrant” pathways.
Other pathways, such as parole or nonimmigrant status, allow you to temporarily live and work in the United States. Although some of these nonimmigrant pathways cannot be extended indefinitely, they can provide more time to demonstrate eligibility for a permanent resident pathway.
Nonimmigrant or Parole (Temporary) Pathways
For more details, see our Nonimmigrant or Parole (Temporary) Pathways for Entrepreneur Employment in the United States page.
IER
The start-up business must be organized and lawfully conduct business in the United States and be formed within the five years immediately preceding your initial application. It must also have substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation.
B-1
Temporary Business Visitor
E-2
You must invest a substantial amount of capital and have at least 50% ownership or possession of operational control.
You must develop and direct the investment enterprise.
Up to two-year initial approval plus two-year extensions, with no maximum duration of status and no annual numerical limit.
F-1 OPT 
H-1B
Three-year initial approval plus extensions for up to three additional years. Extensions beyond the six-year limit may be available for individuals who are in the process of obtaining lawful permanent resident status.
L-1A
Intracompany transferee
The U.S. entity must have a qualifying relationship with your foreign employer.
You must be in a managerial or executive position, in which you primarily perform duties of an executive or managerial nature.
O-1
Immigrant (Permanent) Pathways
Lawful permanent residents may work in the United States without restriction. Before you obtain lawful permanent resident status, you may be able to apply for employment authorization if you file an application to adjust your status to lawful permanent resident. 
For more details, see our Immigrant Pathways for Entrepreneur Employment in the United States page.
EB-1A
Employment-Based First Preference – Extraordinary Ability
To qualify, you must show sustained national or international acclaim and achievements that have been recognized in your field. You must intend to continue to work in this field and show that you will substantially benefit the United States in the future.
EB-2 with National Interest Waiver (NIW)
Employment-Based Second Preference – Exceptional ability or advanced degree professional with national interest waiver of the job offer and the labor certification
A national interest waiver may be granted if you establish that:
your proposed endeavor has both substantial merit and national importance
you are well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor; and
on balance, it would be beneficial to the United States to waive the job offer and thus the permanent labor certification requirements.

You are also required to establish exceptional ability (a level of expertise significantly above that ordinarily encountered) or that you are an advanced degree professional (the job requires, and you possess, a degree above a bachelor’s, or a bachelor’s followed by at least five years of progressive experience).
EB-5
You must invest a certain amount of lawfully obtained capital in a new commercial enterprise that will create at least 10 jobs for qualifying employees.
That amount is $1.05 million generally, or $800,000 if investing in a Targeted Employment Area or an infrastructure project. These amounts automatically adjust on Jan. 1, 2027."

Nonimmigrant pathways offer opportunities to work in the United States for a specified length of time and for a range of reasons. They do not provide lawful permanent residence, although many people who come to the United States on nonimmigrant visas subsequently transition to permanent resident pathways, and eventually U.S. citizenship. The following nonimmigrant pathways also permit you to bring your spouse and children under the age of 21 with you to the United States.
F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT)
Generally, F-1 international students are not permitted to work in the United States. However, F-1 students may be eligible for Optional Practical Training (OPT). OPT permits an F-1 student to work in a position that is directly related to the student’s major area of study for up to 12 months. An F-1 student may be authorized for pre-completion OPT (before completion of the course of study) or post-completion OPT (after completion of the course of study). The time granted for post-completion OPT will be reduced by any time spent in pre-completion OPT. F-1 students who earned a degree in certain STEM fields are eligible for a 24-month extension of post-completion OPT, for a total of 36 months. This guide provides information for post-completion OPT, which is the most common type of OPT. Information about pre-completion OPT while working towards a degree is available on our Optional Practical Training (OPT) for F-1 Students page.
Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?
You may be eligible for Optional Practical Training (OPT) if you are an F-1 student in the United States and you seek employment that is directly related to your major area of study. 
For the initial 12-month OPT:
You have been a full-time student in good standing for at least 1 full academic year
You are currently maintaining F-1 status
Your proposed work must be directly related to your major area of study
For post-completion OPT, you may apply up to 90 days before you complete your degree, but no later than 60 days after
For post-completion OPT, you must apply within 30 days after your designated school official (DSO) enters the recommendation for OPT into your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record

For the 24-month STEM OPT extension:
In addition to the above requirements for the initial 12-month OPT, you are an F-1 student who received a STEM degree included on the STEM Designated Degree Program List  (PDF).
You may apply up to 90 days before your current OPT authorization expires.
You must apply within 60 days after your DSO enters the recommendation for STEM OPT into your SEVIS record.

Do I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?
You do not need to have a job offer before applying for the initial 12-month OPT. However, your proposed work must be directly related to your major area of study. Additionally, you cannot be unemployed for an aggregate of more than 90 days during any post-completion OPT period.
For the 24-month STEM OPT period, you must be employed by an employer who is enrolled in and is using E-Verify and signs a Training Plan for STEM OPT Students  (PDF) (Form I-983).
For both initial OPT and the 24-month STEM OPT extension, you must submit the application directly to USCIS (Form I-765; more information here). An employer does not submit a petition for you.
Will I be working in the United States on a permanent basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?
You will be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time.
For the initial OPT period, you may be authorized up to a total of 12 months of full-time practical training at each educational level. (For example, you may have 12 months for a bachelor’s degree and another 12 months for a master’s degree). If you have a qualifying STEM degree, you may apply for a 24-month extension of your post-completion OPT. If you earn another qualifying STEM degree at a higher educational level than the first, you may be eligible for an additional 12-month OPT as well as another 24-month STEM OPT extension.
For example, if you are in a valid period of up to 12 months of post-completion OPT, and you have a STEM degree, you can apply to extend your post-completion OPT by 24 months for a total OPT period of 36 months. If you earn another STEM degree at a higher level, you can again apply for up to 12 months of post-completion OPT followed by another 24 months of STEM OPT for another OPT total of 36 months at that educational level. A student may not be granted more than two STEM OPT extensions in that student’s lifetime.
Are there any other criteria that are required for this specific pathway?
F-1 students must first request a recommendation for OPT from the designated school official (DSO) at their U.S. college or university, which the DSO will note on the F-1 student’s Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status, in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). Only after securing a DSO endorsement on your Form I-20 and in SEVIS may you file the required Application for Employment Authorization (Form I-765) with USCIS.
In addition, there are timing restrictions on when to duly file your Form I‑765 seeking either post-completion OPT or a 24-month STEM OPT extension. USCIS must receive any Form I-765 for post-completion OPT during the period that is no earlier than 90 days before you complete your degree and ending no later than 60 days after you complete your degree. In addition, your Form I-765 for post-completion OPT must be filed within 30 days after your DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record. For a 24-month STEM OPT extension, USCIS must receive the Form I-765 during the 90-day period prior to the expiration of your post-completion OPT and within 60 days after your DSO enters the recommendation for STEM OPT into your SEVIS record.
F-1 students may not start working in the United States until receiving an employment authorization document (EAD). Working without an EAD can negatively affect your immigration status now and in the future.

H-1B Specialty Occupation
The H-1B pathway enables people with at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) to work in a job that is related to their degree and that qualifies as a “specialty occupation.” There is an annual cap on the number of H-1B workers that can be granted initial H-1B status each year. There are some exceptions to the cap, mainly related to the nature of the U.S. employer. An H-1B worker is permitted to stay in the United States for a maximum of 6 years – but an H-1B worker could stay well beyond 6 years if that worker is on the path to obtaining lawful permanent resident status.
Special note on the H-1B classification
There is an annual cap on the number of H-1B workers that can be granted initial status each year. The H-1B classification has an annual cap of 85,000 for each fiscal year of the U.S. government (Oct. 1 to Sept. 30). That annual cap includes 20,000 status grants set aside solely for workers who have earned a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. institution of higher education. The demand for one of these “cap numbers” is generally extremely high. Therefore, USCIS operates an electronic registration process for employers (prospective petitioners) to register potential workers, and, unless demand for a cap number is unexpectedly low, those registrations are then included in a random selection process. This random selection process is typically conducted in late March or early April. Only those with selected registrations will be eligible to file H-1B cap-subject petitions, typically in early October. H-1B workers who are petitioned by or employed at an institution of higher education (or an affiliated or related nonprofit entity), a nonprofit research organization, or a government research organization are not subject to this numerical cap. Petitions that are not subject to the cap may be filed at any time during the year and do not require an electronic registration. Additionally, petitions for workers already in H-1B status and who are switching employers or applying for a renewal period are generally not subject to the cap.
Nationals of Chile and Singapore may qualify for the H-1B1 classification, which has substantially the same requirements as the H-1B classification, but has its own separate cap. Similarly, nationals of Australia may qualify for the E-3 classification, which also has substantially the same requirements as the H-1B classification, but has its own separate cap.
Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?
To qualify as an H-1B specialty occupation worker, you must meet the following requirements:
You must have at least a bachelor's degree in a specific specialty (or the equivalent) related to the position;
You must have any necessary licenses, registrations, or certifications that are required for the position; and
Your H-1B petition must be filed by a U.S. employer or agent on your behalf.

What evidence can be submitted to help USCIS determine that my degree is related to the specialty occupation?
Some of the evidence that is often submitted to demonstrate that your degree is related to the position in which you will be employed includes:
A detailed explanation of the specific duties of the position, the product or service your prospective employer provides, or the complex nature of the role you will perform, and how your degree relates to the role.
Written opinions from experts in the field explaining how your degree is related to the role you will perform.
Printouts from online resources describing the degree fields normally associated with the occupation. 
Evidence that similar companies in your industry require similar degrees for similar positions.

Can I qualify if I do not have a bachelor’s degree?
If you do not have at least a bachelor’s degree in a specialized field that is directly related to the position in which you will be employed, then you may qualify by:
Holding an unrestricted state license, registration, or certification that authorizes you to fully practice the specialty occupation and be immediately engaged in that specialty in the state of intended employment; or
Having education, specialized training, and/or progressively responsible experience that is equivalent to the completion of a U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree in the specialty occupation, and recognition of expertise in the specialty through progressively responsible positions directly related to the specialty. In general, 3 years of progressively responsible work experience or training in the field is considered as equivalent to 1 year of undergraduate education. 

Note: Your sponsoring employer should submit equivalency documents for all foreign degrees. If work experience is considered, your sponsoring employer should submit an equivalency evaluation from an official who has authority to grant college-level credit. If the equivalency evaluation is not from the registrar, your sponsoring employer should submit a statement from the school’s registrar to establish that the particular evaluating official is authorized to grant college-level credit on behalf of his or her institution.
Do I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?
You need to have a job offer and the position must qualify as a “specialty occupation.” In most instances, an employer will file a petition for you.
Your prospective job must meet one of the following criteria:
What evidence can be submitted to help USCIS determine that my position is in an occupation that requires a degree in a specialized field directly related to the position?
You may reference the Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH) from the Department of Labor (DOL) to help determine whether certain jobs normally require at least a bachelor’s degree in a specialized field of study related to the occupation. If the OOH indicates that at least a bachelor’s degree in a specialized field is normally required for the occupation, the sponsoring employer should reference that OOH entry and submit an explanation as to how their position fits within that occupation. If the OOH does not indicate that at least a bachelor’s degree in a related, specialized field is normally required for the position, examples of evidence your sponsoring employer may submit to demonstrate that the position normally requires such a degree include:
Copies of past position announcements, if relevant, that reflect the minimum requirements for the position and that show that the employer normally requires a degree in a specialized field that is directly related to the position.
Documentation showing that the position is so specialized or complex it can only be performed by someone with at least a bachelor’s degree, or its equivalent, in a specialized field of study directly related to the position, including a detailed description of the petitioner’s business/products/services and the duties of the position.
A detailed description of the petitioner’s business/products/services and the duties of the position, along with written opinions from experts confirming that the position is so specialized or complex it can only be performed by someone with at least a bachelor’s degree in a specialized field of study directly related to the position.
Job listings, letters, and/or affidavits from other employers reflecting the minimum requirements for the position and showing that a degree requirement of at least a bachelor’s degree in a specialized field of study is common to the industry in parallel positions among similar organizations.

Will I be working in the United States on a permanent basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?
You will be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time.
Initially, you may be granted up to 3 years to work in the United States (also known as the “validity period”). After your initial validity period, you may be granted extensions of up to 3 years. Generally, you are not eligible for any more extensions once you have been granted a total of 6 years. However, extensions beyond 6 years are permissible and not uncommon if an employer has taken certain steps in helping you apply for lawful permanent resident status (that is, you are the beneficiary of an approved I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker, for which an immigrant visa is not immediately available, or you are the beneficiary of a labor certification or I-140 petition that was filed at least 365 days before the requested H-1B petition start date).
Are there any other criteria that are required for this specific pathway?
Your sponsoring employer must submit a Labor Condition Application (LCA) for your position, certified by the Secretary of Labor, when filing the H-1B petition with USCIS. The LCA serves as proof that the employer is offering, and will offer during the period of authorized employment as an H-1B nonimmigrant, wages that are at least the actual wage level paid by the employer to all other individuals with similar experience and qualifications for the specific employment in question, or the prevailing wage level for the occupational classification in the area of employment, whichever is greater, based on the best information available as of the time of filing the LCA.
O-1A Extraordinary Ability
The O-1A pathway allows nationally or internationally acclaimed talent across many fields the opportunity to work in the United States, and there is no annual numerical cap. There is no specified limit on the number of extensions a person can receive while working on an O-1.
Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?
You may be eligible for an O-1A visa if you have “extraordinary ability” in the sciences, education, business, or athletics, which must be demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim and recognition. You must also be coming to the United States to continue work in your area of extraordinary ability (but the position does not have to require someone of such extraordinary ability). “Extraordinary ability” in the fields of science, education, business, or athletics means you have a level of expertise indicating you are one of the small percentage of people who have risen to the very top of your field.
Requirement 1 - You must be able to establish that you have extraordinary ability in your field.
To establish eligibility for an O-1A visa, the petitioner (your sponsoring employer or an agent) must either provide evidence that you have received a major, internationally recognized award, similar to a Nobel Prize, or (more commonly) must submit evidence that satisfies at least 3 of 8 evidentiary criteria.
The USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance regarding how O-1A eligibility is evaluated, including a chart (reproduced below) that describes STEM-relevant examples of evidence that may satisfy each of the alternate O-1A evidentiary requirements, as well as considerations that are relevant to evaluating such evidence.
Examples:
Awards from well-known national institutions and well-known professional associations.
Certain doctoral dissertation awards and Ph.D. scholarships.
Certain awards recognizing presentations at nationally or internationally recognized conferences.

Considerations:
While many scholastic awards do not have the requisite level of recognition, there are some Ph.D. scholarships or dissertation awards, for example, that are nationally or internationally recognized as awards for excellence such that they may satisfy the requirements of this criterion. Relevant considerations include, but are not limited to:
The criteria use to grant the awards or prizes;
The national or international significance of the awards or prizes in the field;
The number of awardees or prize recipients; and
Limitations on eligible competitors.

Examples:
Membership in certain professional associations.
Fellowships with certain organizations or institutions.

Considerations:
The petitioner must show that membership in the association requires outstanding achievements in the field for which classification is sought, as judged by recognized national or international experts.
Associations may have multiple levels of membership. The petitioner must show that in order to obtain the level of membership afforded to the beneficiary, the beneficiary was judged by recognized national or international experts as having attained outstanding achievements in the field for which classification is sought.
As a possible example, membership in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) at the IEEE fellow level requires, in part, that a nominee have “accomplishments that have contributed importantly to the advancement or application of engineering, science and technology, bringing the realization of significant value to society,” and nominations are judged by an IEEE council of experts and a committee of current IEEE fellows.** As another possible example, membership as a fellow in the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) is based on recognition of a nominee’s “significant, sustained contributions” to the field of artificial intelligence, and is judged by a panel of current AAAI fellows.***
Relevant factors that may lead an officer to a conclusion that the person's membership in one or more associations was not based on outstanding achievements in the field include, but are not limited to, instances where the person's membership was based:
Solely on a level of education or years of experience in a particular field;
On the payment of a fee or by subscribing to an association's publications; or
On a requirement, compulsory or otherwise, for employment in certain occupations, such as union membership.

Examples:
Professional or major print publications (newspaper articles, popular and academic journal articles, books, textbooks, or similar publications) regarding the beneficiary and the beneficiary’s work.
Professional or major online publications regarding the beneficiary and the beneficiary’s work.
Transcript of professional or major audio or video coverage of the beneficiary and the beneficiary’s work.

Considerations:
Published material that includes only a brief citation or passing reference to the beneficiary’s work is not “about” the beneficiary, relating to the beneficiary’s work in the field, as required under this criterion. However, the beneficiary and the beneficiary’s work need not be the only subject of the material; published material that covers a broader topic but includes a substantial discussion of the beneficiary’s work in the field and mentions the beneficiary in connection to the work may be considered material “about” the beneficiary relating to their work.
Moreover, officers may consider material that focuses solely or primarily on work or research being undertaken by a team of which the beneficiary is a member, provided that the material mentions the beneficiary in connection with the work, or other evidence in the record documents the beneficiary’s significant role in the work or research.
In evaluating whether a submitted publication is a professional publication, major trade publication, or major media, relevant factors include the intended audience (for professional and major trade publications) and the relative circulation, readership, or viewership (for major trade publications and other major media).
Examples:
Reviewer of abstracts or papers submitted for presentation at scholarly conferences in the respective field.
Peer reviewer for scholarly publications.
Member of doctoral dissertation committees.
Peer reviewer for government research funding programs.

Considerations:
The petitioner must show that the beneficiary has not only been invited to judge the work of others, but also that the beneficiary actually participated in the judging of the work of others in the same or allied field of specialization.
For example, a petitioner might document a beneficiary’s peer review work by submitting a copy of a request from a journal to the beneficiary to do the review, accompanied by evidence confirming that the beneficiary actually completed the review.
Examples:
Published materials about the significance of the beneficiary’s original work.
Testimonials, letters, and affidavits about the beneficiary’s original work.
Documentation that the beneficiary’s original work was cited at a level indicative of major significance in the field.
Patents or licenses deriving from the beneficiary’s work or evidence of commercial use of the beneficiary’s work.

Considerations:
Analysis under this criterion focuses on whether the beneficiary’s original work constitutes major, significant contributions to the field.
Evidence that the beneficiary’s work was funded, patented, or published, while potentially demonstrating the work’s originality, will not necessarily establish, on its own, that the work is of major significance to the field. However, published research that has provoked widespread commentary on its importance from others working in the field, and documentation that it has been highly cited relative to other works in that field, may be probative of the significance of the beneficiary’s contributions to the field of endeavor.
Similarly, evidence that the beneficiary developed a patented technology that has attracted significant attention or commercialization may establish the significance of the beneficiary’s original contribution to the field. If a patent remains pending, USCIS will likely require additional supporting evidence to document the originality of the beneficiary’s contribution.
Detailed letters from experts in the field explaining the nature and significance of the beneficiary’s contribution(s) may also provide valuable context for evaluating the claimed original contributions of major significance, particularly when the record includes documentation corroborating the claimed significance.
Submitted letters should specifically describe the beneficiary’s contribution and its significance to the field and should also set forth the basis of the writer’s knowledge and expertise.
Examples:
Publications in professionally relevant journals.
Published conference presentations at nationally or internationally recognized conferences.****

Considerations:
In order to meet this criterion, the beneficiary must be a listed author of the submitted article(s) but need not be the sole or first author. In addition, a petitioner need not provide evidence that the beneficiary’s published work has been cited to meet this criterion.*****
In addition, the articles must be scholarly. In the academic arena, a scholarly article reports on original research, experimentation, or philosophical discourse. It is written by a researcher or expert in the field who is often affiliated with a college, university, or research institution and the article is normally peer-reviewed.
In general, it should have footnotes, endnotes, or a bibliography, and may include graphs, charts, videos, or pictures as illustrations of the concepts expressed in the article. In non-academic arenas, a scholarly article should be written for learned persons in that field.
In evaluating whether a submitted publication is a professional publication or major media, relevant factors include the intended audience (for professional journals) and the circulation or readership relative to other media in the field (for major media).
Examples:
Senior faculty or senior research position for a distinguished academic department or program.
Senior research position for a distinguished non-academic institution or company.
Principal or named investigator for a department, institution, or business that received a merit-based government award, such as an academic research or Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant.******
Member of a key committee within a distinguished organization.
Founder or co-founder of, or contributor of intellectual property to, a startup business that has a distinguished reputation.
Critical or essential supporting role for a distinguished organization or a distinguished division of an institution or company, as explained in detail by the director or a principal investigator of the relevant organization or division.

Considerations:
To show a critical role, the evidence should establish that the beneficiary has contributed in a way that is of significant importance to the organization or establishment’s activities. To show an essential role, the evidence should establish that the beneficiary’s role is (or was) integral to the entity. A leadership role in an organization often qualifies as critical or essential.
For a supporting role to be considered critical or essential, USCIS considers other factors, such as whether the beneficiary’s performance in the role is (or was) integral or important to the organization or establishment’s goals or activities, especially in relation to others in similar positions within the organization.
It is not the title of the beneficiary’s role, but rather the beneficiary’s duties and performance in the role that determines whether the role is (or was) critical or essential. Detailed letters from persons with personal knowledge of the significance of the beneficiary’s role can be particularly helpful in analyzing this criterion.
The organization need not have directly employed the beneficiary.
In addition, the organization or establishment must be recognized as having a distinguished reputation. Relevant factors for evaluating the reputation of an organization or establishment can include the scale of its customer base, longevity, or relevant media coverage.
For academic departments, programs, and institutions, officers may also consider national rankings and receipt of government research grants as positive factors in some cases.
For a startup business, officers may consider evidence that the business has received significant funding from government entities, venture capital funds, angel investors, or other such funders commensurate with funding rounds generally achieved for that startup’s stage and industry, as a positive factor regarding its distinguished reputation.
Examples:
Tax returns, pay statements, or other evidence of past salary or remuneration for services.
Contract, job offer letter, or other evidence of prospective salary or remuneration for services.
Comparative wage or remuneration data for the beneficiary’s field, such as geographical or position-appropriate compensation surveys.

Considerations:
If the petitioner is claiming to meet this criterion, then the burden is on the petitioner to provide appropriate evidence establishing that the beneficiary’s compensation is high relative to others working in similar occupations in the field. The following webpages, among others, may be helpful in evaluating the relative compensation for a given field:
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Overview of BLS Wage Data by Area and Occupation webpage; and
The Department of Labor'sCareer One Stop webpage.

Officers should evaluate persons working outside of the United States based on the wage statistics or comparable evidence for that locality, rather than by simply converting the salary to U.S. dollars and then viewing whether that salary would be considered high in the United States.
* The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education recognizes R1 and R2 doctoral universities as having “very high” or “high” research activity, respectively, based on publicly available federal government data regarding the number of doctoral degrees awarded and the amount of total research expenditures. See the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education’s Basic Classification Description webpage.
** See the IEEE’s Steps to Become an IEEE Fellow webpage.
*** See the AAAI Fellows Program webpage.
**** While many articles accepted for presentation at conferences do not result in publication, there are conferences that peer review and publish accepted presentations in professional journals (sometimes called proceedings), such that they may qualify as scholarly articles under this criterion.
*****Instead, officers may consider citation evidence relating to the published work as part of the totality analysis to evaluate whether the record establishes that the beneficiary has sustained national or international acclaim and is among the small percentage at the top of the field. For instance, documentation regarding the total rate of citations to the beneficiary’s body of published work relative to others in the field may indicate a beneficiary’s high overall standing for the purpose of demonstrating that the beneficiary is among the small percentage at the top of the field.
****** See SBIR America’s Seed Fund webpage.
Note: If any of the criteria discussed above do not readily apply to your occupation, the petitioner may submit comparable evidence to establish your eligibility. When the required initial evidence has been provided, USCIS will evaluate the totality of the evidence to determine eligibility.
The Policy Manual also includes guidance regarding the use of comparable evidence to establish eligibility, including use of comparable evidence by individuals in STEM fields, as well as the following guidance regarding how USCIS evaluates the totality of the evidence for O-1A petitions:
When the evidentiary requirements specified above are satisfied, an officer proceeds to evaluate the totality of all the evidence in the record to determine whether the beneficiary has extraordinary ability with sustained national or international acclaim, as described in the O statute and regulations.
At this step, officers may consider any potentially relevant evidence, even if such evidence does not fit one of the above regulatory criteria or was not presented as comparable evidence.
The following are examples of situations where evidence might not directly correspond to the above regulatory criteria or might not be presented as comparable evidence, but would nonetheless be potentially relevant towards demonstrating, in the totality of the evidence, that an O-1A beneficiary is among the small percentage at the top of the field and that the beneficiary has sustained national or international acclaim:*
The record demonstrates that the beneficiary has published articles in particularly highly ranked journals relative to other journals in the field, as demonstrated by, for example, evidence the petitioner provides regarding the journal’s impact factor.** Depending on the level of recognition of the journals in question, as demonstrated by evidence in the record, there may be particular prestige or acclaim associated with publication in such journals, especially if the beneficiary is the most significant contributor to the publication, a senior author, or the sole author of the article(s).
The petitioner provides evidence demonstrating that the total rate of citations to the beneficiary’s body of published work is high relative to others in the field, or the beneficiary has a high h-index*** for the field. Depending on the field and the comparative data the petitioner provides, such evidence may indicate a beneficiary’s high overall standing for the purpose of demonstrating that the beneficiary is among the small percentage at the top of the field.****
The petitioner documents the beneficiary’s employment or research experience is with leading institutions in the field (such as U.S. universities that have been recognized as having high or very high research activity by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education,***** foreign universities with comparably high research activity, or a university that is highly regarded according to a widely recognized metric such as the QS World University Rankings******). Such employment or experience can be a positive factor toward demonstrating that the beneficiary is among the small percentage at the top of the field.
The record establishes that the beneficiary has received unsolicited invitations to speak or present research at nationally or internationally recognized conferences in the field. Although such a role for the conference may not rise to the level of a critical or essential capacity, this type of invitation is generally indicative of a person’s high standing and recognition for achievements in the field.
The record establishes that the beneficiary is named as an investigator, scientist, or researcher on a peer-reviewed and competitively funded U.S. government grant or stipend for STEM research. This type of evidence can be a positive factor indicating a beneficiary is among the small percentage at the top of the beneficiary’s field.

In all cases, the petitioner has the burden of providing sufficient context regarding the above evidence and considerations to demonstrate that the evidence meets the relevant criteria and to establish the beneficiary’s extraordinary ability in the totality of the circumstances.
* Not all cases will have such evidence, nor does a case need such evidence for the petitioner to demonstrate eligibility. Additionally, the list below is a non-exhaustive list of examples, and while the listed factors may be especially relevant to beneficiaries in STEM fields, the guidance applies to all O-1A petitions.
** Impact factor is commonly used as a measure of a journal’s influence; it represents the average number of citations received per article published in that journal during the 2 preceding years. See Garfield, E, The History and Meaning of the Journal Impact Factor, Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol. 295, Iss. 1, p. 90 (2006).
*** The h-index is a tool for measuring a researcher’s output and impact. It is based on the highest number of the researcher’s publications that have been cited at least that same number of times. For example, if a researcher has an h-index of 10, it means the researcher has 10 publications that have 10 or more citations each (but not 11 publications with at least 11 citations each). See Hirsch, J, An Index to Quantify an Individual’s Scientific Research Output (PDF), Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 102, Iss. 46, p. 16569 (2005).
**** This factor is less relevant for beneficiaries early in their career, as such persons have had less time to accumulate citations but may nevertheless have garnered acclaim and risen to the small percentage at the top of the field as demonstrated by other evidence in the record. As stated above, none of the listed factors are required to demonstrate eligibility.
***** The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education uses the R1 and R2 doctoral university designations to recognize institutions as having “very high” or “high” research activity, respectively, based on publicly available federal government data regarding the number of doctoral degrees awarded and the amount of total research expenditures. See the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education’s Basic Classification Description webpage.
****** The QS World University Rankings annually evaluate universities according to a methodology based on six consistent and empirical metrics: academic reputation (40%), employer reputation (10%), faculty to student ratio 20%), citations per faculty (20%), international faculty ratio (5%), and international student ratio (5%). These metrics are used to rank universities, as well as capture and assess university performance. See the QS World University Rankings Methodology webpage.
Do I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?
You must be coming to the United States to continue work in your area of extraordinary ability. This is typically established by showing that you have a job offer with an employer in the United States.
The petition must be filed by a U. S. employer, a U.S. agent, or a foreign employer through a U.S. agent. While the regulations prohibit an O-1A beneficiary from serving as the sponsoring employer for themselves, a separate legal entity (such as a corporation or limited liability company) that is partially or wholly owned by the beneficiary may file the petition on behalf of the O-1A owner.
Will I be working in the United States on a permanent basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?
You will be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time.
Initially, you may be granted up to 3 years to work in the United States (also known as the “validity period”). After your initial validity period, you may be granted extensions of up to 1 year. There is no specified limit to the number of extensions you can obtain.
L-1 Intracompany Transferee
L-1 visas provide a pathway for employees of multinational companies who hold positions as managers/executives or have specialized knowledge, allowing them to work in the U.S. for a maximum of up to seven years.
Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?
You may be eligible for an L-1 visa for “intracompany transferees” if you are an executive, manager, or a worker with specialized knowledge who has worked abroad for a qualifying organization (including an affiliate, parent, subsidiary or branch of your foreign employer) for at least 1 year within the 3 years preceding the filing of your L-1 petition (or in some cases your admission to the United States) in an executive or managerial capacity or in a position that requires specialized knowledge. USCIS divides L-1 visas into L-1A, for managers or executives, and L-1B, for workers possessing specialized knowledge.
Have you been working abroad for at least one continuous year within the past 3 years? (Note: brief trips to the United States do not typically interrupt the continuous year. Also, time off work such as for a vacation, maternity leave, etc. do not typically interrupt the continuous year.)
Some of the evidence typically submitted to document overseas employment for 1 out of the last 3 years includes:
Pay stubs
Payroll records
Tax returns that show employment
Evidence of work product

Was your overseas employment in a qualifying capacity?
Some of the evidence typically submitted to demonstrate that overseas employment was in a managerial, or executive capacity includes:
L-1A Manager or Executive
L-1A managerial or executive positions may correlate with STEM occupations, depending on the individuals and work that is managed. There is no labor market test for an L-1 managerial or executive employee. Executive positions involve employees who make decisions with wide latitude, and who receive minimal oversight. Managerial positions include personnel managers and function managers and involve the supervision and control of professional employees’ work, or management of an organization or a part thereof. Some of the evidence that may be submitted to demonstrate that your overseas employment was in an executive or managerial capacity includes:
Organization charts showing your position
Patents or other evidence of the company’s technology, products, or services that are based on your work
Performance reviews
Loans/financing on behalf of the company
Organizational job descriptions for your position and those positions that reported above and/or below you, if applicable
Resume describing your job duties and accomplishments

L-1B Specialized Knowledge Worker
L-1B specialized knowledge frequently overlaps with STEM occupations, as it involves “special knowledge of your employer’s product, service, research, equipment, techniques, management, or other interests and their application in international markets, or an advanced level of knowledge or expertise in your employer’s processes and procedures.” Some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate that your overseas employment was in a specialized knowledge capacity includes:
Job descriptions
Organizational charts showing your position
Patents or other evidence of the company’s technology, products or services that are based on your work

Note: There is no requirement that an employee’s specialized knowledge be “unique” or “proprietary” in nature, but your knowledge must be “special” or of an “advanced” level. There is no labor market test for an L-1 specialized knowledge employee.
USCIS has extensive guidance on the various means to demonstrate specialized knowledge, which are too extensive to be summarized here.
Do I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?
You need to have a job offer and that position must be an executive or managerial position, as described above, or one that involves specialized knowledge. Also as noted above, the position must be with an entity that has a qualifying relationship with your foreign employer. The employer must file a petition for you.
Does your company abroad have and will maintain a qualifying relationship (parent, subsidiary, affiliate, or branch) to the U.S. business that will employ you or that you will establish?
The U.S. entity must have a qualifying relationship with the foreign entity abroad where you have been employed as a manager, executive, or worker with specialized knowledge. This means that the U.S. entity must be a parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or branch of the foreign entity, and that both the U.S. entity or office and a foreign entity must continue to have a qualifying relationship throughout the beneficiary’s stay in the United States.
Some of the evidence typically submitted to show that a U.S. business has the requisite qualifying relationship to an overseas employer includes:
Articles of incorporation/organization or similar organizational documents showing common ownership of the U.S. and foreign entities
By-laws, operating agreement, partnership agreement or similar operating documents showing common ownership of the U.S. and foreign entities
Business licenses or other documents showing common ownership of the U.S. and foreign entities
Annual reports or U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Form 10-K describing the corporate structure of the U.S. and foreign entities
Contracts or other documents detailing the qualifying relationship between the U.S. and foreign entities
Federal income tax or other corporate filings in the United States or abroad describing the corporate relationship
Any other evidence demonstrating ownership and control over the U.S. and foreign entities (for example, stock purchase agreements, voting rights agreements, capitalization table, term sheet).

Will I be working in the United States on a permanent basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?
You will be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time.
Initially, you may be granted up to 3 years (1 year if you are setting up a new office) to work in the United States (also known as the “validity period”). After your initial validity period, you may be granted extensions of up to 2 years. You are not eligible for any more extensions once you have been granted a total of 7 years if you are an executive or a manager, or 5 years if you are a specialized knowledge worker.
Can the L visas be used to expand an existing enterprise into the U.S.?
One specific use of the L visa can be to open a new office in the United States that has a qualifying relationship with an existing overseas entity. The petition must demonstrate that the new office will support a managerial or executive position within 1 year. Specialized knowledge workers may also qualify for a new office petition. If approved, the validity period is 1 year. After that 1 year, the new office must submit an extension request by filing a new application or petition. If approved, that extension will be valid and subject to the same provisions as all other (non-new office) L petitions.
Will you be coming to the United States to open a new office location for a foreign business entity that employed you abroad?
Will the new office be active and operating shortly after you arrive in the United States as an L-1?

TN NAFTA/USMCA Professional
Mexican and Canadian nationals can use the TN classification to work in the United States for professional purposes in qualifying professions (this list includes a number of STEM-related occupations).
The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement (USMCA), which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), is the basis for the TN classification. The TN nonimmigrant classification permits qualified Canadian and Mexican citizens to seek temporary entry into the United States to engage in business activities at a professional level. There is no time limit on how long someone may be in TN status.
Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?
The TN classification may be useful for STEM professionals such as engineers, pharmacists, and scientists. Not all professions qualify, but many of those that do are STEM-related. A full list of qualifying professions is included in the regulations. You may be eligible for TN nonimmigrant status, if:
You are a citizen of Canada or Mexico;
Your profession qualifies under the regulations above; and
You have the qualifications, such as a license, to practice in the profession in question.

Do I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?
You need to have a job offer and that position must be a position in the United States that requires a TN professional. You must also have a prearranged full-time or part-time job with a U.S. employer (self-employment is not allowed). If you are a Canadian outside the United States you may apply, with certain information provided to you by your employer, at certain CBP-designated U.S. ports of entry or at a designated pre-clearance/pre-flight inspection station. If you are a Mexican outside the United States, you must apply, with the information provided to you by your employer, at a U.S. Consulate. If you are a Mexican or Canadian citizen inside the United States in a nonimmigrant status, your employer submits a petition to USCIS for you.

Will I be working in the United States on a permanent basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?
You will be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time.
Initially, you may be granted up to 3 years to work in the United States (also known as the “validity period”). After your initial validity period, you may be granted extensions of up to 3 years. There is no specified limit to the number of extensions you can obtain.
Are there any other criteria that are required for a specific pathway?
The TN classification is only for Canadian or Mexican nationals. Nationals of other countries are not eligible nor are permanent residents of Canada or Mexico.
More Information
If you are a Canadian citizen, you are not required to apply for a TN visa at a U.S. Consulate, and may establish eligibility for TN classification by seeking admission to the United States at certain CBP-designated U.S. ports of entry or at a designated pre-clearance/pre-flight inspection station. You must provide the following documentation to the CBP officer:
Proof of Canadian citizenship;
Letter from your prospective employer detailing items such as the professional capacity in which you will work in the United States, the purpose of your employment, your length of stay, and your educational qualifications; and
Credentials evaluation (if applicable), together with any applicable fees.

Please refer to CBP’s website for additional information and requirements for applying for admission to the United States. If a CBP officer finds you eligible for admission, you will be admitted as a TN nonimmigrant.
Mexican citizens must apply for a TN visa directly at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in Mexico. See the U.S. Department of State webpage, Visas for Mexican and Canadian NAFTA Professional Workers.
If you are a Mexican or Canadian citizen already in the United States, your employer may submit Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker to USCIS to either extend or change your status to TN. Premium processing service is available.
J-1 STEM Exchange Visitors
The J-1 exchange visitor category is for nonimmigrants approved to participate in work and study-based exchange visitor programs. The J-1 program is administered by the Department of State (DOS). More information about the program is available at the DOS website.
In January 2022, DOS announced measures to increase the flow of talent in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The Early Career STEM Research Initiative connects certain J-1 program sponsors with STEM-relevant sponsors, including businesses.
Information on the education, experience, and skills required to qualify is available at the DOS website."
Optional Practical Training Extension for STEM Students (STEM OPT),https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/optional-practical-training-extension-for-stem-students-stem-opt,"
Certain F-1 students who receive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees may apply for a 24-month extension of their post-completion optional practical training (OPT).
Eligibility for the STEM OPT Extension
To qualify for the 24-month extension, you must:
Have been granted OPT and currently be in a valid period of post-completion OPT;
Have earned a bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degree from a school that is accredited by a U.S. Department of Education-recognized accrediting agency and is certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) at the time you submit your STEM OPT extension application.
	Previously obtained STEM degrees: If you are an F-1 student participating in a 12-month period of post-completion OPT based on a non-STEM degree, you may be eligible to use a previous STEM degree from a U.S. institution of higher education to apply for a STEM OPT extension. You must have received both degrees from currently accredited and SEVP-certified institutions, and cannot have already received a STEM OPT extension based on this previous degree. The practical training opportunity also must be directly related to the previously obtained STEM degree.
		For example: If you are currently participating in OPT based on a master’s degree in business administration but you previously received a bachelor’s degree in mathematics, you may be able to apply for a STEM OPT extension based on your bachelor’s degree as long as it is from an accredited U.S. college or university and the OPT employment opportunity is directly related to your bachelor’s degree in mathematics.

STEM degrees you obtain in the future: If you enroll in a new academic program in the future and earn another qualifying STEM degree at a higher educational level, you may be eligible for one additional 24-month STEM OPT extension.
		For example: If you receive a 24-month STEM OPT extension based on your bachelor’s degree in engineering and you later earn a master’s degree in engineering, you may apply for an additional 24-month STEM OPT extension based on your master’s degree.


Work for an employer who meets all the requirements listed below in the STEM OPT Employer Responsibilities section.
Submit the Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, up to 90 days before your current OPT employment authorization expires, and within 60 days of the date your designated school official (DSO) enters the recommendation for OPT into your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record.

Previously obtained STEM degrees: If you are an F-1 student participating in a 12-month period of post-completion OPT based on a non-STEM degree, you may be eligible to use a previous STEM degree from a U.S. institution of higher education to apply for a STEM OPT extension. You must have received both degrees from currently accredited and SEVP-certified institutions, and cannot have already received a STEM OPT extension based on this previous degree. The practical training opportunity also must be directly related to the previously obtained STEM degree.
		For example: If you are currently participating in OPT based on a master’s degree in business administration but you previously received a bachelor’s degree in mathematics, you may be able to apply for a STEM OPT extension based on your bachelor’s degree as long as it is from an accredited U.S. college or university and the OPT employment opportunity is directly related to your bachelor’s degree in mathematics.

STEM degrees you obtain in the future: If you enroll in a new academic program in the future and earn another qualifying STEM degree at a higher educational level, you may be eligible for one additional 24-month STEM OPT extension.
		For example: If you receive a 24-month STEM OPT extension based on your bachelor’s degree in engineering and you later earn a master’s degree in engineering, you may apply for an additional 24-month STEM OPT extension based on your master’s degree.


For example: If you are currently participating in OPT based on a master’s degree in business administration but you previously received a bachelor’s degree in mathematics, you may be able to apply for a STEM OPT extension based on your bachelor’s degree as long as it is from an accredited U.S. college or university and the OPT employment opportunity is directly related to your bachelor’s degree in mathematics.

For example: If you receive a 24-month STEM OPT extension based on your bachelor’s degree in engineering and you later earn a master’s degree in engineering, you may apply for an additional 24-month STEM OPT extension based on your master’s degree.

Applying for a STEM OPT Extension
To apply for an extension, you must properly file:
Form I-765 with
	The correct application fee,
Your employer’s name as listed in E-Verify, and
Your employer’s E-Verify Company Identification Number or valid E-Verify Client Company Identification Number

Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status, endorsed by your DSO within the last 60 days; and
A copy of your STEM degree.

The correct application fee,
Your employer’s name as listed in E-Verify, and
Your employer’s E-Verify Company Identification Number or valid E-Verify Client Company Identification Number

If you file your STEM OPT extension application on time and your OPT period expires while your extension application is pending, we will automatically extend your employment authorization for 180 days. This automatic 180-day extension ceases once USCIS adjudicates your STEM OPT extension application. F-1 students who have a pending STEM OPT extension application are not eligible for the temporary increase of the automatic extension period under the temporary final rule published on May 4, 2022. That temporary increase of the automatic extension period under 8 CFR 274a.13(d) only applies to the categories listed in the chart on the Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension page.
After Receiving a STEM OPT Extension
Student Reporting Responsibilities
If you receive a STEM OPT extension, you must:
Report changes to the following information to your DSO within 10 days of the change:
	Your legal name
Your residential or mailing address
Your email address
Your employer’s name
Your employer’s address

Report to your DSO every 6 months to confirm the information listed above, even if none of your information has changed.

Your legal name
Your residential or mailing address
Your email address
Your employer’s name
Your employer’s address

For more information, please refer to the DHS STEM OPT Hub.
Unemployment during the OPT Period
You may be unemployed during your OPT period for a limited number of days.
STEM OPT Employer Requirements and Responsibilities
If you are an employer who wants to provide a practical training opportunity to a STEM OPT student during their extension, you must:
Be enrolled in E-Verify, as evidenced by either a valid E-Verify company identification number or, if the employer is using an employer agent to create its E-Verify cases, a valid E-Verify client company identification number.
Remain a participant in good standing with E-Verify, as determined by USCIS.
Have a valid Employer Identification Number (EIN) issued by the Internal Revenue Service for tax purposes.
Report material changes of the STEM OPT student’s employment by submitting a modified Form I-983 to the DSO at the earliest available opportunity.
Report the STEM OPT student’s termination of employment or departure to the DSO within 5 business days.
Implement a formal training program to augment the student’s academic learning through practical experience.
Provide an OPT opportunity that is commensurate with those of similarly situated U.S. workers in duties, hours, and compensation.

Terms and Conditions for Employer Participation
To ensure the integrity of the program and provide safeguards for U.S. workers, any employer wishing to employ a student participating in the STEM OPT extension program must ensure that:
The employer will have and maintain a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student.
The employer has sufficient resources and personnel available to provide appropriate training in connection with the specified opportunity at the location(s) specified in the Form I-983, Training Plan for STEM OPT Students.
The STEM OPT student will not replace a full- or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. worker.
The training opportunity will assist the student in attaining his or her training goals.

DHS may, at its discretion, conduct a site visit of the employer to ensure that program requirements are being met, including that the employer possesses and maintains the ability, personnel, and resources to provide structured and guided work-based learning experiences consistent with the training plan.
The Employer’s Training Obligation
As noted above, to be eligible to employ a STEM OPT student, an employer must have and maintain a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student. The employer must attest to this fact by signing the Form I-983, Training Plan for STEM OPT Students. To establish a bona fide relationship, the employer may not be the student’s “employer” in name only, nor may the student work for the employer on a “volunteer” basis. Moreover, the employer that signs the Form I-983 must be the same entity that provides the practical training experience to the student.
An employer must have sufficient resources and trained or supervisory personnel available to provide appropriate training in connection with the specified training opportunity at the location(s) where the student’s practical training experience will take place, as specified in the Form I-983. The “personnel” who may provide and supervise the training experience may be either employees of the employer, or contractors who the employer has directly retained to provide services to the employer; they may not, however, be employees or contractors of the employer’s clients or customers. Additionally, under no circumstances would another F-1 student with OPT or a STEM OPT extension (who is undergoing training in their own right) be qualified to train another F-1 student with a STEM OPT extension.
While employers may rely on their existing training programs or policies to satisfy the requirements relating to performance evaluation and oversight and supervision, the student’s Training Plan must nevertheless be customized for the individual student. For instance, every Training Plan must describe the direct relationship between the STEM OPT opportunity and the student’s qualifying STEM degree, as well as the relationship between the STEM OPT opportunity and the student’s goals and objectives for work-based learning. Moreover, a STEM OPT employer may not assign, or otherwise delegate, its training responsibilities to a non-employer third party (e.g., a client/customer of the employer, employees of the client/customer, or contractors of the client/customer).
As noted above, DHS, at its discretion, may conduct a site visit of any STEM OPT employer to ensure that the employer possesses and maintains the ability and resources to provide structured and guided work-based learning experiences consistent with the Form I-983. See 8 C.F.R. 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C)(11). Consistent with this provision, during a site visit, DHS may verify that the employer that signs the Form I-983 is the same entity that provides the practical training experience to the student and ensure compliance. For ICE to effectively conduct these site visits as part of its oversight responsibilities, it is important that employers report any change in a student’s employment address. As indicated above, the employer and student must report such a material change by submitting a modified Form I-983 to the DSO at the earliest available opportunity.
The Employer’s Training Obligation: Staffing and Temporary Agencies
Staffing and temporary agencies and consulting firms may seek to employ students under the STEM OPT program, but only if they will be the entity that provides the practical training experience to the student and they have and maintain a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student. STEM OPT participants may engage in a training experience that takes place at a site other than the employer’s principal place of business as long as all of the training obligations are met, including that the employer has and maintains a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student. Certain types of arrangements, including multiple employer arrangements, sole proprietorships, employment through ‘‘temp’’ agencies, employment through consulting firm arrangements that provide labor for hire, and other similar relationships may not be able to demonstrate a bona fide employer-employee relationship and, therefore, may not meet the requirements of the STEM OPT extension.
As part of the STEM OPT extension, employers must complete the appropriate parts of Form I-983, Training Plan for STEM OPT Students. In this form, employers attest that:
They have enough resources and trained personnel available to appropriately train the student;
The student will not replace a full- or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. worker; and
Working for them will help the student attain their training objectives.

DHS will review on a case-by-case basis whether the student will be a bona fide employee of the employer signing the training plan, and verify that the employer that signs the training plan is the same entity that employs the student and provides the practical training experience.
For more information, please refer to the DHS STEM OPT Hub."
Immigrant Pathways for STEM Employment in the United States,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/stem-employment-pathways/immigrant-pathways-for-stem-employment-in-the-united-states,"
中文 (PDF, 250.08 KB)  | 한국어 (PDF, 428.48 KB)  | Русский (PDF, 361.57 KB)
Immigrant pathways offer opportunities to work in the United States for a range of reasons on a more permanent basis. They provide lawful permanent residence (Green Card), which can eventually lead to U.S. citizenship.
The lawful permanent resident process involves two or three steps, depending on the employment-based immigrant visa classification sought. In general, most petitioners (typically employers) filing EB-2 and EB-3 petitions must take the first step of filing an Application for Permanent Employment Certification (ETA Form 9089  (PDF)), commonly known as a labor certification, with the Department of Labor (DOL). An approved permanent labor certification application demonstrates that:
The petitioner tested the labor market in the geographic area where the permanent job offer is located to establish that there are no able, qualified, and available U.S. workers who are willing to accept the permanent job offer; and
The employment of the beneficiary will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.

After certification from DOL, the petitioner submits the certified labor certification with an immigrant visa petition to USCIS. In all cases, the process requires the two steps of filing of an immigrant petition with USCIS and either an adjustment application with USCIS (if you are in the United States) or an immigrant visa application with the Department of State (DOS) (if you are outside the United States or not pursuing adjustment of status).
An approved immigrant visa petition secures your priority date that will determine the order of immigrant visa availability. You may only file an adjustment application or request a visa through a consulate once an immigrant visa is immediately available. If an immigrant visa is immediately available when you or your sponsoring employer files the petition with USCIS, you may file your adjustment application at the same time. You are eligible to apply for work authorization concurrently with your adjustment application and while your adjustment application is pending.
The availability of an immigrant visa will depend on the employment-based classification being sought (typically the availability is greater for the higher preferences), and the immigrant’s country of chargeability (usually the country of birth).
As a general matter, EB-1 immigrant visas tend to be immediately available to any qualifying applicant, regardless of country of origin. For EB-2 and EB-3 immigrant visas, however, there is typically a queue for nationals of China and India.
The USCIS webpage Visa Availability and Priority Dates and Consular Processing provides information about the DOS Visa Bulletin process and explain how DOS allocates immigrant visas and consular processing generally.
EB-1A Extraordinary Ability
Persons of extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics may self-petition to enter the United States permanently to continue working in their area of extraordinary ability.
You may be eligible for the EB-1A extraordinary ability immigrant visa classification if you have extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics as demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim and recognized achievements in your field of expertise. In addition, you must show that you will continue working in your area of extraordinary ability. Extraordinary ability means that your level of expertise indicates that you are one of the small percentage of individuals who have risen to the very top of your field.
Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?
You must be able to establish that you have extraordinary ability in your field.
The EB-1A extraordinary ability classification is for people who are recognized as being at the very top of their field and who are coming to the United States to continue work in that field. To establish eligibility, you must demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and that your achievements, including STEM achievements, have been recognized in your field by showing: (1) that you have received a major internationally recognized award, similar to a Nobel Prize; or, more commonly, (2) that you meet at least 3 of the 10 requirements listed below and all your evidence, when evaluated together, shows that you are among the small percentage of individuals that have risen to the very top of your field. If you have not received a major internationally recognized award, you must submit evidence that, more likely than not, affirmatively answers at least 3 of the 10 questions below:
Have you received any lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor?
Are you, or have you been, a member of an association that requires outstanding achievements of its members as judged by recognized national or international experts?
Is there published material in professional or major trade publications or major media about you that relates to your work in the field?
Have you participated on a panel or individually as a judge of the work of others in the same or in an allied field of specialization?
Have you made an original scientific, scholarly, or business-related contribution to the field that is of major significance?
Have you authored any scholarly articles in professional journals or other major media?
Has your work been displayed at an artistic exhibition or showcase?
Have you played a leading or critical role for an organization with a distinguished reputation?
Have you commanded a high salary or other remuneration for your services in comparison to others in your field?
Have you enjoyed commercial successes in the performing arts?

Note: If the criteria discussed in this section do not readily apply to your occupation, you may submit comparable evidence to establish your eligibility. However, there is no comparable evidence for the one-time achievement of a major, internationally recognized award.
If you meet these minimum threshold requirements, USCIS will then evaluate all the evidence you submitted in its totality to determine whether you have sustained national or international acclaim and recognized achievements in your field of expertise and that you are one of the small percentage of individuals who have risen to the very top of your field.
The USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance regarding how EB-1A eligibility is evaluated, including an appendix chart that describes considerations that are relevant to evaluating evidence under each of the above criteria and evaluating comparable evidence.
Do I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?
You do not need to have a job offer – but you must be able to establish that you are coming to the United States to continue to work in your area of extraordinary ability. You may submit the petition yourself directly to USCIS, or a company may file a petition on your behalf.
Some of the evidence typically submitted to demonstrate that a person is coming to the United States to continue to work in your area of extraordinary ability includes:
Letters from current or prospective employers,
Documents evidencing your prearranged commitments (such as contracts), or
A statement detailing your plans on how you intend to continue working in your field in the United States.

Will I be working in the United States on a permanent (no time limit) basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?
You will be working in the United States on a permanent basis if you are granted lawful permanent resident status.
EB-1B Outstanding Professors and Researchers
Professors and researchers who are internationally recognized as outstanding may be eligible to come to the United States permanently to work for an institution of higher education or private employer when the prospective employer files a petition on their behalf.
You may be eligible for EB-1B classification as an outstanding professor or researcher if you are internationally recognized for your outstanding achievements in a particular academic field. You must have at least 3 years of experience in teaching or research in that academic area. You must also be entering the United States to pursue a tenure or tenure track teaching or comparable research position at a university, institution of higher education, or private employer.
Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?
You must be able to establish that you are recognized internationally as outstanding in the academic field specified in the petition.
To establish eligibility for an EB-1B visa, your sponsoring employer must submit documentation that you have at least 3 years of experience in teaching or research in the academic field. The 3 years of experience may include teaching or research while pursuing your advanced degree if you received that degree and, for teaching, if you had full responsibility for the class or the research was recognized within the academic field as outstanding. You must also submit evidence that, more likely than not, affirmatively answers at least 2 of the 6 questions below:
Have you received a major prize or award for outstanding achievement?
Are you, or have you been, a member of an association that requires outstanding achievements of its members?
Is there published material in professional publications about your work in the academic field?
Have you participated on a panel or individually as a judge of the work of others in the same or in an allied academic field?
Have you made original scientific or scholarly contributions in the field?
Have you authored scholarly books or articles (in scholarly journals with international circulation) in the academic field?

Note: If any of the criteria discussed in this section do not readily apply, your sponsoring employer may submit comparable evidence to establish your eligibility.
If you meet these minimum threshold requirements, USCIS will then evaluate all the evidence you submitted in its totality to determine whether you are recognized internationally as outstanding in your academic field.
The USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance regarding EB-1B eligibility, including an appendix chart that describes considerations that are relevant to evaluating evidence under each of the above criteria and evaluating comparable evidence.
Do I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?
You must have a job offer from a United States employer that is a university, institution of higher learning, or private employer that employs at least 3 persons full-time in research positions. That same employer must file a petition for you, but because no labor certification is required, the employer does not have to apply through the Department of Labor before filing with USCIS. The job offer must be in the form of a letter that offers you a tenure or tenure track position or a permanent research position.
Will I be working in the United States on a permanent (no time limit) basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?
You will be working in the United States on a permanent basis if you are granted lawful permanent resident status.
EB-1C Multinational Managers and Executives
Certain managers and executives with experience working abroad for a multinational company may be eligible to come work permanently in the United States for a U.S. company with a qualifying relationship to the company abroad.
You may be eligible for EB-1C classification if you a have a permanent job offer in a primarily managerial or executive position with a qualifying U.S. employer that has been doing business for at least 1 year and you have been employed for at least 1 year by a related organization abroad to work in a capacity that is managerial or executive. While you need a sponsoring employer, because no labor certification is required, the employer does not have to apply through the Department of Labor before filing with USCIS.
Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?
You must have at least 1 year of qualifying experience.
To establish EB-1C eligibility, you must have been employed, in a primarily executive or managerial capacity, outside the United States for at least 1 year in the 3 years immediately preceding the filing of the petition or the most recent lawful nonimmigrant admission if you are already in the United States.
Do I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?
You must have a job offer to work in a primarily managerial or executive position for a United States employer that has a qualifying relationship with your foreign employer. The U.S. employer must file a petition for you.
A qualifying relationship
A qualifying relationship exists when the U.S. employer is an affiliate, parent, or subsidiary of the foreign firm, corporation, or other legal entity. To establish a qualifying relationship under the statute and the regulations, the petitioner must show that the beneficiary's foreign employer and the proposed U.S. employer are the same employer (for example, a U.S. entity with a foreign office) or related as a parent and subsidiary or as affiliates.
Both the U.S. employer and at least one qualifying organization abroad must continue to do business up until the time of visa issuance or adjustment of status, and the U.S. employer must have been actively engaged in doing business for at least 1 year at the time of filing of the petition.
A qualifying position
To qualify for EB-1C classification, you must be coming to the United States to work in a primarily managerial or executive position with a qualifying U.S. employer. Managerial capacity includes personnel and function manager positions that manage, supervise and control certain personnel or organizational functions while executive capacity includes executive positions that direct management, establish goals and policies, and exercise wide latitude in discretionary decision making within an organization.
Will I be working in the United States on a permanent (no time limit) basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?
You will be working in the United States on a permanent basis if you are granted lawful permanent resident status.
EB-2 Advanced Degree Professionals and Persons of Exceptional Ability
A professional with an advanced degree or a person of exceptional ability may enter the United States to work for a petitioning employer or, if self-petitioning, in a proposed endeavor by requesting a waiver of the labor certification process in the national interest.
The EB-2 classification is divided into two sub-categories: professionals with advanced degrees and individuals with exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business. Although a job offer from an employer and a labor certification from the Department of Labor are generally required for the EB-2 classification, you may be eligible to self-petition if you are asking for a waiver of the labor certification requirement based on the national interest. This self-petition, which does not require a sponsoring employer and skips the labor certification process, is known as a national interest waiver.
Note: The labor certification process confirms that there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, qualified, and available to accept the job opportunity in the area of intended employment and that employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. More information on the labor certification process is available in the USCIS Policy Manual, and on the Department of Labor’s website.
If you are requesting a waiver of the job offer (and thus, the labor certification) because it is in the national interest of the United States, you are eligible to file a petition on your own behalf, and you may do so whether you seek to classify yourself as a member of a profession who has an advanced degree or as an individual of exceptional ability.
Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?
We will review all the evidence you submit to determine whether you are eligible for the employment based second preference classification and, if requested, whether it is in the national interest of the United States to grant a discretionary waiver of the job offer and labor certification requirement.
Employment Based Second Preference: EB-2 Classification - General Requirements
You must be a professional with an advanced degree or a person with exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business. You are generally required to have a job offer and a labor certification from the Department of Labor.
Requirements for Advanced Degree Professional Classification
To qualify for classification as an advanced degree professional, you must be a member of the professions holding an advanced degree or foreign equivalent degree, and the position certified in the underlying labor certification must require, at a minimum, a professional holding such a degree (a bachelor’s followed by at least 5 years of progressively responsible experience is considered the equivalent of an advanced degree).
You will need to provide documentation, such as an official academic record showing that you have a U.S. advanced degree or a foreign equivalent degree, or an official academic record showing that you have a U.S. bachelor’s degree or a foreign equivalent degree and letters from current or former employers showing that you have at least 5 years of progressive post-bachelor’s work experience in the specialty. If a doctoral degree is customarily required by the specialty, you must have a U.S. doctorate or foreign equivalent degree.
The USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance on how we determine eligibility for advanced degree professionals.
Requirements for Exceptional Ability Classification
To qualify for the EB-2 exceptional ability classification, you must show that you have exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business. Your initial evidence must include evidence that affirmatively answers at least 3 of the 6 questions below:
Have you received a degree, diploma, certificate or similar award from a college, university, school, or other institution, relating to the field of exceptional ability?
Do you have at least 10 years of full-time experience in your field, as demonstrated by letters from current or former employers?
Do you have a license or certification to practice in your profession or occupation?
Have you commanded a high salary or other remuneration for your services, which demonstrates your exceptional ability?
Are you a member of any professional associations?
Have you been recognized for any achievements and significant contributions to the industry by peers, governmental entities, or professional or business organizations?

Note: If any of the criteria discussed in this section do not readily apply to your occupation, you may submit comparable evidence to establish your eligibility.
If you meet these minimum threshold requirements, USCIS will then evaluate all the evidence you submitted in its totality to determine whether you have a degree of expertise significantly above that normally encountered in the sciences, arts, or business.
The USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance on how we determine eligibility for exceptional ability classification.
Do I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?
The EB-2 classification normally requires a job offer from a U.S. employer. In general, the U.S. employer first obtains a labor certification approval from the Department of Labor and then files a petition on your behalf with USCIS.
For nurses who may qualify under EB-2, and physical therapists, a labor certification from the Department of Labor is not required. Instead, the petition is submitted with an uncertified ETA Form 9089 for consideration as Schedule A, Group I occupation. More information on Schedule A, Group I is available in the USCIS Policy Manual.
You may seek a waiver of the job offer (and thus the labor certification requirement) and petition for yourself with no U.S. employer if you can establish that it is in the national interest to waive the job offer requirement.
National Interest Waiver Requirements
USCIS may, as a matter of discretion, grant your request for a national interest waiver where the below requirements are met:
Your proposed endeavor has both substantial merit and national importance.
You are well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor.
On balance, it would be beneficial to the United States to waive the requirements of a job offer, and thus the labor certification.

The USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance on how we evaluate eligibility for national interest waivers based on the above requirements, and it also includes a discussion of specific evidentiary considerations for those well positioned to advance STEM endeavors. For example, the USCIS Policy Manual explains how an advanced degree in a STEM field tied to a proposed endeavor in a critical and emerging technology or supports U.S. national security or economic competitiveness is a strong positive factor, as are letters from interested government agencies.
Critical and emerging technologies are those that are critical to U.S. national security, including military defense and the economy. To identify a critical and emerging technology field, USCIS considers governmental, academic, and other authoritative and instructive sources, and all other evidence submitted by the petitioner. The lists of critical and emerging technology subfields published by the Executive Office of the President, by either the National Science and Technology Council or the National Security Council, are examples of authoritative lists. For example, the National Science and Technology Council’s Critical and Emerging Technologies List Update  (PDF) (February 2022) identifies critical and emerging technologies “with the potential to further these [national security] objectives,” meaning security of Americans, economic prosperity, or democratic values. Departments and agencies may consult this list “when developing, for example, initiatives to research and develop technologies that support national security missions, compete for international talent, and protect sensitive technology from misappropriation and misuse.” The list is part of A Report by the Fast Track Action Subcommittee on Critical and Emerging Technologies.
A STEM area is important to competitiveness or security in a variety of circumstances. For example, when the evidence in the record demonstrates that an endeavor will help the United States to remain ahead of strategic competitors or current and potential adversaries, or relates to a field, including those that are research and development-intensive industries. One, but certainly not the only, indicator of STEM areas important to U.S. competitiveness is inclusion as a priority in the annual research and development priorities memo about the President’s budget issued jointly by the White House Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. For example, the Memorandum on Research and Development Priorities  (PDF) (August 2021) for President Biden’s FY2022 budget is indicative of STEM areas important to U.S. competitiveness. U.S. national security objectives are outlined in the Interim National Security Strategic Guidance  (PDF). These objectives include: protect the security of the American people; expand economic prosperity and opportunity; and realize and defend democratic values. For purposes of national interest waiver policy and adjudications, “national security” refers to these three objectives.
Many proposed endeavors that aim to advance STEM technologies and research, whether in academic or industry settings, not only have substantial merit in relation to U.S. science and technology interests, but also have sufficiently broad potential implications to demonstrate national importance. On the other hand, while proposed classroom teaching activities in STEM, for example, may have substantial merit in relation to U.S. educational interests, such activities, by themselves, generally are not indicative of an impact in the field of STEM education more broadly, and therefore generally would not establish their national importance.
USCIS considers an advanced degree, particularly a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), in a STEM field tied to the proposed endeavor and related to work furthering a critical and emerging technology or other STEM area important to U.S. competitiveness or national security, an especially positive factor to be considered along with other evidence for purposes of the assessment under the second prong.
When evaluating the third prong and whether the United States may benefit from the person’s entry, regardless of whether other U.S. workers are available (as well as other factors relating to prong three discussed above, such as urgency), USCIS considers the following combination of facts contained in the record to be a strong positive factor:
The person possesses an advanced STEM degree, particularly a Ph.D.;
The person will be engaged in work furthering a critical and emerging technology or other STEM area important to U.S. competitiveness; and
The person is well positioned to advance the proposed STEM endeavor of national importance.

The benefit is given particular weight where the endeavor has the potential to support U.S. national security or enhance U.S. economic competitiveness, or when the petition is supported by letters from interested U.S. government agencies.
Will I be working in the United States on a permanent (no time limit) basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?
You will be working in the United States on a permanent basis if you are granted lawful permanent resident status.
EB-3 Skilled Workers, Professionals, and Other (Unskilled) Workers
Skilled workers, professionals, and other workers may be eligible to permanently work in the United States if petitioned by a sponsoring U.S. employer.
“Skilled workers” are persons whose jobs require a minimum of 2 years’ training or experience (including in STEM fields). The skilled worker must meet the educational, training, or experience requirements of the job opportunity as listed on the labor certification. Relevant post-secondary education, such as an associate’s degree in telecommunications technology, may be considered as training.
“Professionals” are persons whose job requires at least a U.S. bachelor’s or foreign equivalent degree and are a member of the professions.
“Other workers” are persons whose jobs require less than 2 years’ training or experience. The other worker must meet the educational, training, or experience requirements of the job opportunity as listed on the labor certification.  Because STEM occupations generally do not fall under the other worker classification, it is not further addressed in this guide.
Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?
You must have at least 2 years of experience or training (relevant post-secondary education may be considered as training) to qualify as a skilled worker. You must have at least a U.S. bachelor’s degree (or a foreign equivalent degree) to qualify as a professional. While a foreign degree that is not equivalent to a U.S. bachelor’s degree will not qualify you for classification as a professional, it may still qualify you as a skilled worker.
The USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance on how we determine eligibility for skilled workers, professionals, and other workers.
Do I need to have a job offer?  Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?
Third preference petitions must be filed by a sponsoring employer, and must generally be accompanied by an approved labor certification from the Department of Labor on ETA Form 9089  (PDF). For nurses and physical therapists who may still qualify under EB-3, the petition is submitted directly to USCIS with an uncertified ETA Form 9089 for consideration as Schedule A, Group I occupation. More information on Schedule A, Group I is in the USCIS Policy Manual.
More information on the labor certification process is available in the USCIS Policy Manual, and on the Department of Labor website.
Will I be working in the United States on a permanent (no time limit) basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?
You will be working in the United States on a permanent basis if you are granted lawful permanent resident status."

The United States has long been a destination for top talent from all over the world. Our ability to attract global talent—especially in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)—has spurred path-breaking innovation, leading to the creation of jobs, new industries, and new opportunities for all Americans.
This online resource provides an overview of some of the temporary and permanent pathways for noncitizens to work in the United States in STEM fields. This guide also highlights some of the most important considerations for STEM professionals contemplating working in the United States. Subsequent sections outline these pathways in more detail.  
More information on how to apply is available on uscis.gov for both temporary and permanent pathways as well as for optional practical training for students. In addition, a general guide to employment in the United States can be found in the Working in the United States section of uscis.gov. You may wish to consult with an attorney to evaluate the best classification for you.
Key Questions to Consider When Choosing a STEM Pathway
Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?
Some pathways, such as the O-1 nonimmigrant visa classification and the EB-1A immigrant visa classification, are for those with “extraordinary ability.” These require that a person have widespread and sustained acclaim. Others, such as the H-1B, require at least a relevant bachelor’s degree or equivalent. And others, such as the L-1, require a pre-existing relationship with a company that does business both in the United States and abroad. 
Do I need to have a job offer?  Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?
Most pathways require you to already have a job offer, in which case an employer will submit a petition to USCIS on your behalf. However, some classifications do not require a job offer and permit you to directly submit an application or petition with USCIS (“self-petitioning”). For example, if you are seeking lawful permanent resident status (a Green Card) based on a classification as an individual with “extraordinary ability” (the EB-1A category), you do not need a job offer and do not need an employer to file the immigrant petition on your behalf (meaning, you may self-petition). Although a job offer is not required in this example, you must provide evidence establishing that you are coming to the United States to continue work in your area of expertise.
Will I be working in the United States on a permanent basis as a lawful permanent resident, or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant?
Some opportunities provide a basis for individuals, including STEM professionals, to obtain permanent resident status in the United States. Permanent resident status allows you to live and work in the United States permanently, and typically provides you with a path to citizenship. These opportunities are known as “immigrant” pathways.
Others (for example, F-1 OPT, H-1B, L-1 and O-1), also known as “nonimmigrant” pathways, allow you to temporarily live and work in the United States. Many people who do work through one of these nonimmigrant pathways eventually transition to permanent resident pathways, and eventually U.S. citizenship.
Are there any other criteria that are required for a specific pathway?
Some criteria that are not directly related to professional qualifications can affect visa eligibility. For instance, only citizens of Canada and Mexico qualify for TN visas. In addition, there can be some timing or other requirements particular to certain pathways. For example, some immigrant pathways require the employer to first obtain an approved labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor. The labor certification verifies that there are insufficient able, available, qualified, and willing U.S. workers to fill the position and that such employment will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. citizens.
Nonimmigrant (Temporary) Pathways
For more details, see our Nonimmigrant Pathways for STEM Employment in the United States page.
F-1 OPT
Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) and 24-Month STEM OPT Extension for F-1 Students
H-1B
Specialty occupation
3-year initial approval + one 3-year extension.  Additional extensions may be available for individuals who are in the process of obtaining lawful permanent resident status. 
Due to an annual statutory cap, there is typically a random selection process to determine which petitions are eligible to be filed for an initial H-1B period (unless exempt from the cap). H-1B extension petitions are not subject to the cap.
J-1
Exchange Visitor(STEM)
J-1 business trainees typically may stay for up to 18 months. 
 
O-1
Extraordinary ability
L-1A
Intracompany transfer of a manager or executive of a multinational firm
L-1B
Intracompany transfer of a specialized knowledge worker of a multinational firm
TN
NAFTA/USMCA Professional (limited to Mexican and Canadian nationals)
Immigrant (Permanent) Pathways
Lawful permanent residents may work in the United States without restriction. Before you obtain permanent resident status, you may be able to apply for employment authorization when you file an application to adjust your status to lawful permanent resident. 
For more details, see our Immigrant Pathways for STEM Employment in the United States page.

USCIS administers the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, which was created by Congress in 1990 to stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors. Under a program first enacted as a pilot in 1992 and regularly reauthorized since then, investors may also qualify for EB-5 classification by investing through regional centers designated by USCIS based on proposals for promoting economic growth. On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (Public Law 117-103), which created new requirements for the EB-5 immigrant visa category and the Regional Center Program. Immigrant visas are authorized under the Regional Center Program through Sept. 30, 2027. 
This page provides a brief overview of the basic requirements for an EB-5 immigrant visa under the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act. USCIS policy on EB-5 adjudications is in Volume 6, Part G of the USCIS Policy Manual for petitions filed before and after the enactment of the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act. USCIS will continue to update its Policy Manual with the provisions of the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act.
USCIS policy on EB-5 adjudications is in Volume 6, Part G of the USCIS Policy Manual.
All EB-5 investors must invest in a new commercial enterprise that was established:
After Nov. 29, 1990; or
On or before Nov. 29, 1990, that was:
	Purchased and the existing business is restructured or reorganized in such a way that a new commercial enterprise results; or
Expanded through the investment, resulting in at least a 40% increase in the net worth or number of employees.


Purchased and the existing business is restructured or reorganized in such a way that a new commercial enterprise results; or
Expanded through the investment, resulting in at least a 40% increase in the net worth or number of employees.

A new commercial enterprise means any for-profit activity formed for the ongoing conduct of lawful business, including:
A sole proprietorship;
Partnership (whether limited or general);
Holding company and its wholly owned subsidiaries (provided that each subsidiary is engaged in a for-profit activity formed for the ongoing conduct of a lawful business);
Joint venture;
Corporation;
Business trust;
Limited liability company; or
Other entity, which may be publicly or privately owned.

This definition does not include noncommercial activity, such as owning and operating a personal residence.
Job Creation Requirements
An EB-5 investor must invest the required amount of capital in a new commercial enterprise that will create full-time positions for at least 10 qualifying employees.
For a new commercial enterprise not located within a regional center, the new commercial enterprise must directly create the full-time positions to be counted. This means that the new commercial enterprise (or its wholly owned​ subsidiaries) must itself be the employer of the qualifying employees.
For a new commercial enterprise located within a regional center, the new commercial enterprise can directly or indirectly create the full-time positions. Up to 90% of the job creation requirement for regional center investors may be met using indirect jobs.
	Direct jobs establish an employer-employee relationship between the new commercial enterprise and the persons it employs.
Indirect jobs are held outside of the new commercial enterprise but are created as a result of the new commercial enterprise.

In the case of a troubled business, the EB-5 investor may rely on job maintenance.
	The investor must show that the number of existing employees is, or will be, no less than the pre-investment level for a period of at least two years.


Direct jobs establish an employer-employee relationship between the new commercial enterprise and the persons it employs.
Indirect jobs are held outside of the new commercial enterprise but are created as a result of the new commercial enterprise.

The investor must show that the number of existing employees is, or will be, no less than the pre-investment level for a period of at least two years.

A troubled business is one that has been in existence for at least two years and has incurred a net loss during the 12- or 24-month period before the priority date on the immigrant investor’s Form I-526. The loss for this period must be at least 20% of the troubled business’ net worth before the loss. When determining whether the troubled business has been in existence for two years, USCIS will consider successors in interest to the troubled business when evaluating whether they have been in existence for the same period of time as the business they succeeded.
A qualifying employee is a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident, or other immigrant authorized to work in the United States, including a conditional resident, temporary resident, asylee, refugee, or a person residing in the United States under suspension of deportation. This definition does not include immigrant investors; their spouses, sons, or daughters; or any noncitizen in any nonimmigrant status (such as an H-1B nonimmigrant) or who is not authorized to work in the United States.
Full-time employment means employment of a qualifying employee by the new commercial enterprise in a position that requires a minimum of 35 working hours per week. In the case of the regional center program, full-time employment also means employment of a qualifying employee in a position that has been created indirectly that requires a minimum of 35 working hours per week.
A job-sharing arrangement where two or more qualifying employees share a full-time position will count as full-time employment provided the hourly requirement per week is met. This definition does not include combinations of part-time positions even if, when combined, the positions meet the hourly requirement per week.
Jobs that are intermittent, temporary, seasonal, or transient do not qualify as permanent full-time jobs. However, jobs that are expected to last at least two years are generally not considered intermittent, temporary, seasonal, or transient.
Capital Investment Requirements
Capital means cash and all real, personal, or mixed tangible assets owned and controlled by the immigrant investor. All capital will be valued at fair-market value in U.S. dollars.
The definition of capital does not include:
Assets acquired, directly or indirectly, by unlawful means (such as criminal activities);
Capital invested in exchange for a note, bond, convertible debt, obligation, or any other debt arrangement between the immigrant investor and the new commercial enterprise;
Capital invested with a guaranteed rate of return on the amount invested; or
Capital invested that is subject to any agreement between the immigrant investor and the new commercial enterprise that provides the immigrant investor with a contractual right to repayment, except that the new commercial enterprise may have a buy back option that may be exercised solely at the discretion of the new commercial enterprise.

Note: Immigrant investors must establish that they are the legal owner of the capital invested. Capital can include their promise to pay (a promissory note) in certain circumstances.
The minimum investment amounts by filing date and investment location are:
Future adjustments will be tied to inflation using the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) from March 15, 2022, to the date of adjustment. These adjustments will occur every five years, with the first such adjustment effective for petitions filed on or after Jan. 1, 2027.
A targeted employment area can be, at the time of investment, either:
A rural area; or
An area that has experienced high unemployment (defined as at least 150% of the national average unemployment rate).

A rural area is any area other than an area within a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) (as designated by the Office of Management and Budget) or within the outer boundary of any city or town having a population of 20,000 or more according to the most recent decennial census of the United States.
A high-unemployment area consists of the census tract or contiguous census tracts in which the new commercial enterprise is principally doing business, which may include any or all directly adjacent census tracts, if the weighted average unemployment for the specified area based on the labor force employment measure for each tract is 150% of the national unemployment average.
Regional center investors may choose to invest in a new commercial enterprise engaged in an infrastructure project. An infrastructure project is a capital investment project in a filed or approved business plan, which is administered by a governmental entity (such as a Federal, State, or local agency or authority) that is the job-creating entity contracting with a regional center or new commercial enterprise to receive capital investment under the regional center program from alien investors or the new commercial enterprise as financing for maintaining, improving, or constructing a public works project of these set-aside visas that go unused are held in the same set-aside category for one more fiscal year. After the second fiscal year, any remaining unused immigrant visas in these set-aside categories are released to the unreserved EB-5 immigrant visa numbers during the third fiscal year.
Immigrant Visa Set-Asides
The EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act created new EB-5 immigrant visa set-asides for qualified immigrant investors. Each fiscal year, a certain percentage of EB-5 immigrant visas are available to qualified immigrants who invest in specific areas: 
Any of these set-aside visas that go unused are held in the same set-aside category for one more fiscal year. After the second fiscal year, any remaining unused immigrant visas in these set-aside categories are released to the unreserved EB-5 immigrant visa numbers during the third fiscal year."

USCIS will use the EB-5 Integrity Fund primarily to administer the EB-5 Regional Center Program, as required by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022. Starting Mar. 2, 2023, we will collect an annual fee from each designated regional center to finance the EB-5 Integrity Fund. Read more here: USCIS to Start Collecting Fee for EB-5 Integrity Fund.
ALERT: Beginning Sept. 1, 2022, we will no longer accept a single, combined fee payment when an applicant or petitioner files Form I-526, Immigrant Petition by Standalone Investor, or Form I-526E, Immigrant Petition by Regional Center Investor, together with Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, Form 131, Application for Travel Document, or Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. Petitioners may combine the fee payment for Forms I-485, I-131, and I-765. However, petitioners must send a separate fee payment for Form I-526 or Form I-526E.
If a petitioner or applicant submits a single, combined fee payment for Forms I-526 or I-526E and the other forms, USCIS will reject the forms for improper fee payment and return the fee.
An EB-5 regional center is an economic unit, public or private, in the United States, involved with promoting economic growth. We designate regional centers for participation in the Immigrant Investor Program.

Regional Center Terminations,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-fifth-preference-eb-5/eb-5-immigrant-investor-regional-centers/regional-center-terminations,"
We will issue a Notice of Intent to Terminate a regional center’s participation in the Immigrant Investor Program if the regional center:
Fails to submit required information to USCIS; or
No longer serves the purpose of promoting economic growth.

For our legal authority, see 8 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 204.6(m)(6).
USCIS must give a regional center 30 days from the center’s receipt of the Notice of Intent to Terminate (NOIT) to offer evidence opposing the ground or grounds alleged in the notice. See 8 CFR 204.6(m)(6).
Note: A NOIT does not prevent the regional center from continuing to operate. A NOIT is not the same as a Notice of Termination.  Depending on the decision, a NOIT may or may not lead to termination.
We review any response to the NOIT and decide whether to terminate the regional center’s designation.
If we do not terminate the designation, we will notify the regional center through a Notice of Reaffirmation. This notice means that the regional center remains approved to participate in the Immigrant Investor Program.
If we terminate the designation, we will notify the regional center of the reasons through a Notice of Termination of the regional center’s participation in the Immigrant Investor Program.
A terminated regional center may appeal the decision. In addition to, or instead of, filing an appeal, a terminated regional center may file a motion to reopen and reconsider the decision.
For filing information, see 8 CFR 103.3 and 103.5 and visit the Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion page.
A regional center that USCIS has terminated from the EB-5 program may not solicit, generate, or promote investors or investments or otherwise participate as a designated regional center in connection with the Immigrant Investor Program.
An EB-5 investor’s conditional permanent resident status, if already obtained, does not automatically end if that individual has invested in a new commercial enterprise associated with a regional center that USCIS has removed from the program. The investor will still have the opportunity to demonstrate compliance with EB-5 program requirements. For more details on the compliance requirements, visit EB-5 Regional Center Compliance Reviews.
Below is a list of EB-5 regional centers that USCIS has removed from the Immigrant Investor Program. These regional centers no longer appear on the list of Approved EB-5 Immigrant Investor Regional Centers.
An asterisk (*) next to a regional center’s name means that the decision to remove the regional center from the Immigrant Investor Program is currently pending before the USCIS Administrative Appeals Office on appeal or certification  (PDF, 125.43 KB).
A regional center that USCIS has removed from the EB-5 program may not solicit, generate, or promote investors or investments for any other EB-5-related projects, or otherwise participate in the Immigrant Investor Program.

USCIS Announces New EB-5 Regional Center Program
On March 15, President Biden signed a law that includes authority for an EB-5 Immigrant Investor Regional Center Program and various implementation effective dates for the program. The program will be in effect through Sept. 30, 2027. We are reviewing the new legislation and will provide additional guidance.

Approval of an EB-5 regional center application does not in any way:
Constitute USCIS endorsement of the activities of that regional center;
Guarantee compliance with U.S. securities laws; or
Minimize or eliminate risk to the investor.

Potential investors should seek professional advice when making any investment decisions.
Regional centers can operate in more than one state. Because this table lists regional centers by state, some centers appear on the list more than once. The Regional Center Terminations page lists regional centers that USCIS has removed from the program.
USCIS is reviewing inquiries about the previously posted Form I-526 and Form I-829 approval and denial statistics by regional center. To provide feedback on that data, please send an email to USCIS.ImmigrantInvestorProgram@uscis.dhs.gov.

EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/eb-5-immigrant-investor-program,"
See Alerts and Latest News
USCIS administers the EB-5 Program. Under this program, investors (and their spouses and unmarried children under 21) are eligible to apply for lawful permanent residence (become a Green Card holder) if they:
Make the necessary investment in a commercial enterprise in the United States; and
Plan to create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for qualified U.S. workers.

This program is known as EB-5 for the name of the employment-based fifth preference visa that participants receive.
Congress created the EB-5 Program in 1990 to stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors. In 1992, Congress created the Immigrant Investor Program, also known as the Regional Center Program, which sets aside EB-5 visas for participants who invest in commercial enterprises associated with regional centers approved by USCIS based on proposals for promoting economic growth.

Vacated rule modernizing the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program
On June 22, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, in Behring Regional Center LLC v. Wolf, 20-cv-09263-JSC, vacated the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program Modernization Final Rule  (PDF).
While USCIS considers this decision, we will apply the EB-5 regulations that were in effect before the rule was finalized on Nov. 21, 2019.
Under the vacated rule published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, several changes to the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program that went into effect Nov. 21, 2019 are no longer in effect.
The new rule modernizes the EB-5 program by:
Providing priority date retention to certain EB-5 investors;
Increasing the required minimum investment amounts to account for inflation;
Reforming certain targeted employment area (TEA) designations;
Clarifying USCIS procedures for the removal of conditions on permanent residence; and
Making other technical and conforming revisions.

What You Need to Know:
Priority date retention
Certain immigrant investors will keep the priority date of a previously approved EB-5 petition when they file a new petition.

Increased minimum investments 
The standard minimum investment amount has increased to $1.8 million (from $1 million) to account for inflation.
The minimum investment in a TEA has increased to $900,000 (from $500,000) to account for inflation.
Future adjustments will also be tied to inflation (per the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, or CPI-U) and occur every 5 years.

Targeted employment area (TEA) designations
We will now directly review and determine the designation of high-unemployment TEAs; we will no longer defer to TEA designations made by state and local governments.
Specially designated high-unemployment TEAs will now consist of a combination of census tracts that include the tract or contiguous tracts in which the new commercial enterprise is principally doing business, including any or all directly adjacent tracts.
Provided they have experienced an average unemployment rate of at least 150% of the national average unemployment rate, TEAs may now include cities and towns with a population of 20,000 or more outside of metropolitan statistical areas.
These changes will help direct investment to areas most in need and increase the consistency of how high-unemployment areas are defined in the program.

Clarified procedures for the removal of conditions on permanent residence
The new rule specifies when derivative family members (for example, a spouse and children whose immigration status comes from the status of a primary benefit petitioner) who are lawful permanent residents must independently file to remove conditions on their permanent residence;
The new rule includes flexibility in interview locations; and
The new rule updates the regulations to reflect the current process for issuing Green Cards.

Class Action Member Identification Notice
On Nov. 30, 2018, in the case of Zhang v. USCIS, No. 15-cv-995, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia certified a class that includes anybody who has a Form I-526, Immigrant Petition by Alien Investor, that was or will be denied on the sole basis of investing loan proceeds that were not secured by their own assets. The court vacated these denials and ordered USCIS to reconsider the petitions.
In May 2019, we sent letters to all petitioners whose petitions we denied and to petitioners who withdrew their I-526 petitions. We wanted to make sure to notify all potential class members. If you received this notification and do not believe that you are a potential class member, please disregard the letter; you do not need to take any further action.
On Jan. 28, 2019, we appealed the court’s decision. On Oct. 27, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision. With this decision, the court certified the class, and we are reopening and adjudicating class member petitions consistent with the court’s decision.

On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed into law the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022. Among other things, Sec. 107 of the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 codified many of the same restrictions from the Ethics and Integrity: Protocols for Processing of EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa Petitions and EB-5 Regional Center Applications, Including Stakeholder Communications (PDF, 347.4 KB), which were issued by the secretary of homeland security in 2015. The act mandates that DHS employees act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any entity, organization, or individual in connection with any aspect of the EB-5 program, and -- as was done under the 2015 Ethics and Integrity Protocols-- certain DHS and USCIS employees must take the EB-5 Ethics and Integrity Protocols Training (PPTX, 20.21 MB).
The act also mandates certain channels and offices for industry stakeholders, petitioners, applicants, and seekers of benefits under the EB-5 program to use for communicating with DHS about specific EB-5 cases and about non-case-specific EB-5 concerns. (Except for communication made by applicants and petitioners pursuant to regular adjudicatory procedures.) These channels and offices are:
Email to uscis.immigrantinvestorprogram@uscis.dhs.gov;
The USCIS Contact Center;
USCIS Office of Public Engagement; and
The Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman.

Other Form I-526 Questions and Answers
Can I file an appeal or motion if I disagree with a decision about my FormI-526?
The decision notice will indicate whether you may file an appeal and/or a motion. For information about filing requirements for appeals and motions, see 8 CFR 103.3 and 103.5 and Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion.
If someone contacts me about investing in an EB-5 project, how can I find out if the project is legitimate?
You should always do your own research and consult with a financial professional before making any investment decision. (For informational purposes only, USCIS lists all approved regional centers and terminated regional centers on Approved EB-5 Immigrant Investor Regional Centers and Regional Center Terminations pages.)
Find additional program information at EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program.
If I am pursuing consular processing, can I come to the United States as soon as my Form I-526 petition is approved?
No. For more information, see Consular Processing.
Does approval of Form I-526 guarantee I will be granted a visa or admitted to the United States?
No. An approved Form I-526 petition does not guarantee that the U.S. Department of State will issue you an EB-5 visa or that USCIS will grant adjustment of status if you are in the United States. Also, the issuance of a visa does not guarantee your entry into the United States.
As an investor, do I have to live in the same city where the project is located?
No. You do not have to live in the same city or state as the new commercial enterprise or the project.
Do I have to physically visit a regional center through which I want to invest?
No. USCIS does not require an on-site visit of the regional center, but investors should always do their own research and consult with a financial professional before making any investment decision.
Can I pursue other ways to immigrate to the United States while USCIS processes my Form I-526 petition?
Yes. You may pursue other ways to immigrate to the United States while USCIS processes your Form I-526 petition. However, you must be able to demonstrate eligibility for any benefit you seek.
How long does USCIS take to process a Form I-526 petition?
For current estimates, see Check Case Processing Times. However, processing times can vary depending on the circumstances of each case. These circumstances include factors such as the time it takes to complete a background check and whether we need to request additional evidence.
Form I-829, Petition by Investor to Remove Conditions on Permanent Resident Status
What if my child turns 21 while my Form I-829 petition is pending?
Children who turn 21 while your Form I-829 is pending can still have the conditions on their permanent resident status removed, assuming USCIS approves the petition.
When must I file Form I-829?
You must file your Form I-829 petition within the 90 calendar day period before the second anniversary of obtaining conditional permanent resident status. For more information, refer to the Form I-829 instructions (PDF, 399.14 KB).
Why can’t I view my Form I-829 case status online?Case Status Online is only available to the Form I-829 petitioner who was initially the primary Form I-526 petitioner. This Form I-829 petitioner can check their case status using the Form I-829 receipt number.
Why do I have two receipt numbers?
When you properly file Form I-829, you are provided with a receipt notice that extends your conditional permanent resident status by 18 months and, along with your Green Card, also authorizes you to work and travel. Once USCIS has scheduled you for a biometrics appointment, you will then receive another receipt number related to your biometrics appointment.
Are copies of Schedule K-1 sufficient to establish sustainment of investment?
USCIS adjudicates every petition on a case-by-case basis. Please see the Form I-829 Instructions and 8 CFR 216.6 for information about the evidence you must submit with your petition. If you use copies of Schedule K-1, you must show that your investment was sustained throughout your conditional residency period.
What happens if I do not file Form I-829 or I miss the filing deadline?
If you fail to file your Form I-829 petition within the 90 days preceding the second anniversary of obtaining conditional permanent resident status, USCIS will terminate your conditional permanent resident status and you will become removable from the United States. However, if your failure to file within that 90-day period was for good cause and due to extenuating circumstances, you may file your petition late with a written explanation and request that USCIS excuse your late filing. If you can show good cause and extenuating circumstances, USCIS, in its discretion, may accept a late petition. USCIS decides such requests on a case-by-case basis.
Should I be in the United States when my I-829 petition is filed?
You may file your I-829 petition regardless of whether you are in the United States. However, if you are outside the United States, you must return for your biometrics appointment or, if necessary, to comply with USCIS interview requirements.
Form I-956, Application for Regional Center Designation
Are regional centers affiliated with USCIS?
No. USCIS designates an entity as a “regional center” for purposes of participating in the EB-5 program, but regional centers are not affiliated with USCIS or the Department of Homeland Security.
Note: USCIS approval of a regional center for participation in the EB-5 program does not constitute any endorsement by the U.S. government. For more information, see Approved EB-5 Immigrant Investor Regional Centers and Regional Center Terminations

Form I-924A, Annual Certification of Regional Center
For filing tips, go to Annual Reporting Information / Filing Tips: Form I-924A, Annual Certification of Regional Center.
What are general tips for submitting evidence? When submitting evidence, keep in mind:
Inconsistencies in documents: There may be legitimate reasons for inconsistencies. For example, the dimensions listed on preconstruction contracts for house purchases may vary from the actual dimensions shown on other documents. When submitting documents, providing explanations and evidence to reconcile inconsistencies reduces the chances of a Request for Evidence (RFE).
Unavailability of documents: Explaining and providing evidence for why a particular document is not available reduces the chances of an RFE. For example, if claiming that proof of prior employment is unavailable because a company no longer exists, you may wish to submit evidence that the company has been dissolved.
Probative value of evidence: “Probative value” refers to whether a document proves or supports a claim or eligibility requirement. Submitting evidence with greater probative value and credibility reduces the chances of an RFE.
Incomplete translations: USCIS requires complete English translations of all foreign language documents submitted as evidence. Ensuring that foreign language documents are translated in their entirety before submitting them reduces the chances of an RFE or Request for Clarification.

Special Immigrant Religious Workers,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-fourth-preference-eb-4/special-immigrant-religious-workers,"
ALERT: On March 22, 2023, the Department of State posted the April 2023 Visa Bulletin, as well as a Federal Register Notice (PDF) explaining certain changes to the Final Action Dates and Dates for Filing for the Employment-Based Fourth Preference Immigrant Visa Category.
Ministers and non-ministers in religious vocations and occupations may immigrate to or adjust status in the U.S. for the purpose of performing religious work in a full-time compensated position.
Sunset Date for Non-Minister Religious Workers Program
On Dec. 29, 2022, the president signed into law H.R. 2617, extending the EB-4 non-minister special immigrant religious worker program through Sep. 30, 2023. The law allows these workers to immigrate or adjust to permanent resident by that date, also known as the sunset date. Non-minister special immigrant religious workers include those within a religious vocation or occupation engaged in either a professional or non-professional capacity. This date on which the program will end also applies to accompanying spouses and children of these non-minister special immigrant religious workers.
Special immigrants entering the U.S. solely to carry on the vocation of a minister, and their accompanying spouses and children, are not affected by the sunset date.
Religious Worker Expedite Requests
The decision to accommodate an expedite request is at USCIS’ sole discretion. We consider all expedite requests on a case-by-case basis. To increase efficiency in the review and processing of expedite requests, we are not required to provide justification regarding decisions on expedite requests.
A nonprofit organization whose request furthers the cultural or social interests of the United States may request expedited processing. For petitioners who are selected for a pre-adjudication compliance review site visit, USCIS cannot process the petitioner's request for expedited processing of Form I-360 Special Immigration Religious Worker petition until a successful compliance review is completed.
The request must demonstrate the urgent need to expedite the case based on the beneficiary’s specific role within the nonprofit in furthering cultural or social interests (as opposed to the organization’s role in furthering cultural or social interests). Examples may include a medical professional urgently needed for medical research related to a specific “social” U.S. interest (such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other socially impactful research or project). As another example, a religious organization may urgently need a beneficiary’s specific services and skill set to continue a vital social outreach program. In such instances, the religious organization must explain why the beneficiary is specifically needed, as opposed to pointing to a general shortage.
A special immigrant religious worker is a noncitizen who is coming to the United States to work full time (an average of at least 35 hours per week) in a compensated position as a minister or in a religious vocation or occupation and be employed by a:
Non-profit religious organization in the United States;
Religious organization that is authorized by a group tax exemption holder to use its group tax exemption; or
Non-profit organization which is affiliated with a religious denomination in the United States.

To qualify, you must have been a member of a religious denomination having a bona fide non-profit religious organization in the United States for at least two years immediately before filing the petition. In addition, you must have been working in one of the positions described above after the age of 14, either abroad or in the United States, continuously for at least two years immediately before the filing of a petition with USCIS. The prior religious work does not need to correspond precisely to the type of work you will perform. A break in the continuity of the work during the preceding two years will not affect eligibility so long as:
You were still employed as a religious worker;
The break did not exceed two years; and
The nature of the break was for further religious training or sabbatical. However, you must have been a member of the petitioner’s denomination throughout the two years of qualifying employment.

A U.S. employer, or you on your own behalf, must file Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant, to request special immigrant religious worker classification. Both you and the employing non-profit religious organization must satisfy the requirements listed below. If a petitioner believes that one of these requirements substantially burdens the organization’s exercise of religion, the petitioner may seek an exemption under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). A written request for the exemption should accompany the initial filing, and it must explain how the provision:
Requires participation in an activity prohibited by a sincerely held religious belief; or
Prevents participation in conduct motivated by a sincerely held religious belief.

The petitioner bears the burden of showing that they qualify for a RFRA exemption and must support the request with relevant documentation. We decide exemption requests on a case-by-case basis.
The below table provides an overview of the evidentiary requirements for this classification. For further information about eligibility requirements and USCIS policy related to the special immigrant religious worker classification, see the USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 6, Immigrants, Part H, Designated and Special Immigrants, Chapter 2, Religious Workers.
Proof of Tax-Exempt Status
If the religious organization has its own individual IRS 501(c)(3) letter, the petitioner must provide a currently valid determination letter* from the IRS showing that the organization is tax-exempt.
If the organization is recognized as tax-exempt under a group tax exemption, the petitioner must provide a currently valid IRS group tax-exemption determination letter and documentation that the organization is covered under the group tax exemption. Examples include a:
Letter from the parent organization authorizing the petitioner to use its group tax exemption;
Directory for that organization listing the petitioner as a member of the group;
Membership listing on the parent organization’s website that confirms coverage under its exemption; or
Letter from the IRS confirming the coverage.

If the IRS determination letter does not identify the organization’s tax exemption as a religious organization, then the petitioner must submit evidence establishing the organization’s religious nature and purpose. This may include, but is not limited to, the entity’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, flyers, articles, brochures, or other literature that describes the religious purpose and nature of the organization.
If the organization is affiliated with the religious denomination, the petitioner must provide:
A currently valid determination letter from the IRS showing that the organization is tax-exempt;
Documentation that establishes the religious nature and purpose of the organization, including, but not limited to:
				A copy of the organizing instrument of the organization that specifies the purposes of the organization;
Organizational literature describing the religious purpose and nature of the activities of the organization; and

A religious denomination certification, included as part of the Form I-360, stating that the petitioning organization is affiliated with the religious denomination.**

A copy of the organizing instrument of the organization that specifies the purposes of the organization;
Organizational literature describing the religious purpose and nature of the activities of the organization; and

Proof of Salaried or Non-Salaried Compensation
The petitioner must submit verifiable evidence showing how the prospective employer intends to compensate the religious worker, including specific monetary or in-kind compensation. Evidence may include:
Past evidence of compensation for similar positions;
Budgets showing monies set aside for salaries, or leases;
Evidence that the prospective employer will provide room and board to the religious worker; and

W-2 form or certified tax returns. If IRS documents are not available, the petitioner must explain why and provide comparable, verifiable documentation.
For additional information about USCIS policy related to the compensation requirements, see the USCIS Policy Manual.
Proof of Denominational Membership and Evidence Regarding the Prospective Position
The petitioner must submit:
Evidence that the religious worker is a member of a religious denomination having a bona fide non-profit religious organization in the United States for at least two years immediately before filing Form I-360; and
Evidence to establish that the religious worker is qualified to perform the duties of the offered position. If the religious worker will work as a minister, the petitioner must provide:
				A copy of the religious worker’s certificate of ordination or similar documents; and
Documents showing the religious denomination accepted the religious worker’s qualification as a minister, as well as evidence that they completed any course of prescribed theological education at an accredited theological institution normally required or recognized by that religious denomination. Include transcripts, curriculum, and documentation that establishes that the theological institution is accredited by the denomination


A copy of the religious worker’s certificate of ordination or similar documents; and
Documents showing the religious denomination accepted the religious worker’s qualification as a minister, as well as evidence that they completed any course of prescribed theological education at an accredited theological institution normally required or recognized by that religious denomination. Include transcripts, curriculum, and documentation that establishes that the theological institution is accredited by the denomination

If the denomination does not require a prescribed theological education, the petitioner must provide:
The religious denomination’s requirements for ordination to minister;
A list of duties performed by virtue of ordination;
The denomination’s levels of ordination, if any; and
Evidence the religious worker completed the denomination’s requirements for ordination.

Proof of Previous Religious Work (Abroad or in the United States)
If the requisite previous employment was in the United States and the religious worker received salaried compensation, the petitioner must provide documents showing they received a salary. This documentation may include, but is not limited to, Form W-2 or certified copies of filed income tax returns reflecting such work and compensation for the prior employment.
If the requisite previous employment was in the United States and the religious worker received non-salaried compensation, the petitioner must provide:
IRS documentation of the non-salaried compensation if available; or
An explanation of why IRS documents are not available and provide comparable, verifiable documentation.

If the religious worker received no salary but supported themselves and any dependents, the petitioner must provide verifiable documents to show how the religious worker maintained support. This may include, but is not limited to, audited financial statements, financial institution records, brokerage account statements, trust documents signed by an attorney, or other verifiable evidence.
If the requisite previous experience was gained abroad, the petitioner must provide comparable evidence of the religious work.
* The IRS determination letter must be valid and cover the petitioning organization at the time the religious organization files Form I-360. A valid determination letter may include a letter that the IRS issued before the effective date of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or may be issued under subsequent Internal Revenue Code revisions.
** The religious denomination certification should be signed by an organization other than the prospective employer, and attest that the prospective employer is part of the same religious denomination as the attesting organization.
On-Site Inspections
Under the regulations at 8 CFR 204.5(m)(12), USCIS may conduct on-site inspections of the petitioning organization either before or after a final decision is made on the petition. If we decide to conduct a pre-approval inspection, satisfactory completion of such inspection will be a condition for us approving your petition.
The religious organization must provide the physical address where you will work, even if that address is not the same as the mailing address, so we may conduct an on-site inspection, if we determine it necessary to verify information and supporting  evidence submitted in the petition. 
In addition, we may inspect your work location after adjudicating the form to verify your work hours, compensation, and duties. We may also complete a post-adjudication inspection in cases of suspected non-compliance with the terms of the visa classification or where the petitioning entity has undergone substantial changes since its last filing. We closely monitor all on-site inspections to ensure program integrity and to prevent undue delays in the adjudication process.
Your spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 may accompany or follow to join you or adjust status in the United States. For more information, please visit our Green Card Eligibility Category page.

I. SIJ Deferred Action: Process and Timelines for Adjudication
Q1. If I file Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant, as a special immigrant juvenile (SIJ), will you make a deferred action assessment at the same time as the Form I-360 assessment?
A1. For most pending and future SIJ cases, we will automatically make a deferred action determination immediately after we approve Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant. This is similar to the process to consider deferred action for self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act. After we adjudicate Form I-360 and deferred action, we will issue a Form I-797, Notice of Action, that includes information about the decision on the Form I-360 and a determination on deferred action.
In certain cases, the deferred action determination may take place after we approve the Form I-360 because USCIS needs additional information to make a decision. In these cases, you will receive notification of the deferred action determination separately from the Form I-360 approval.
If you have an approved SIJ Form I-360, but you become newly eligible for consideration of deferred action due to a visa retrogression, we will consider deferred action for your case. You do not need to make a separate request for deferred action, and if you do, we will not accept it. After we decide whether to grant deferred action, we will issue an amended Form I-797, Notice of Action, that includes information about the original grant of SIJ classification and our determination on deferred action.
Q2. What is the timeline for granting deferred action?
A2. We began making deferred action determinations on May 6, 2022, 60 days after publishing the Policy Manual update announcing the SIJ deferred action policy. Processing times may vary depending on the circumstances of the case.
Q3. If you grant deferred action, and I file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, how long will you take to adjudicate my Form I-765?
A3. We try to adjudicate all benefit requests in a timely manner. We adjudicate Forms I-765 submitted after a grant of SIJ deferred action in the order we receive them. For more information on processing times for Form I-765, please see egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/i765.
Q4. If you already granted me SIJ, can I be considered for deferred action?
A4. Yes. If you have an approved SIJ-based Form I-360, and you cannot apply to adjust your status (get a Green Card) because you do not have a current visa number, we will consider you for deferred action if we have not already. You do not need to take any action or ask us to start this process.
Q5. I am an SIJ-classified noncitizen with a pending Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, and I no longer have a current visa number due to a visa retrogression. Will you consider me for deferred action?
A5. Yes. If you applied for adjustment of status when a visa number was available or when we were accepting Form I-485 based on the “Dates for Filing” chart of the Visa Bulletin, we will consider you for deferred action if the Visa Bulletin subsequently retrogressed and your Form I-485 is still pending.
Q6. I received a Form I-360 approval with no corresponding deferred action decision, and there is no apparent reason for delay. Can you explain why this might happen and what I can do to receive deferred action?
A6. As of May 6, 2022, we are considering deferred action when we adjudicate Form I-360 for all pending and future SIJ-based Form I-360 petitioners who do not have a current visa number available.
Generally, we will issue a deferred action determination together with our decision on Form I-360. However, if we need additional information, which may include requesting biometrics, to make the deferred action determination, we may issue a decision on Form I-360 first.
Q7. If my Form I-360 was approved or pending before the new deferred action process, how do I apply for deferred action?
A7. We will automatically make initial deferred action determinations for approved SIJs who cannot apply for adjustment of status solely because an immigrant visa number is not immediately available. You do not need to submit a separate request for deferred action; if you do, we will not accept it. We will consider deferred action on a case-by-case basis to determine whether you warrant a favorable decision.
Q8. Do I need to submit biometric information to receive an SIJ deferred action determination?
A8. We generally do not require a separate biometrics submission to grant SIJ deferred action. However, we complete background and security checks when we adjudicate an SIJ petition and, depending on the facts and circumstances of your case, we may ask you to submit biometrics or to appear for an interview before we grant deferred action. See 8 CFR 103.2(b)(9).
Q9. Are there factors you consider for deferred action that are not already part of the Form I-360 adjudication?
A9. Deferred action is a temporary, favorable exercise of discretion that gives some cases lower priority for immigration enforcement action. We examine the totality of the circumstances in an individual case and weigh positive and negative factors to determine whether to grant deferred action.
If you have been approved for SIJ classification, that is a strong positive factor toward granting deferred action. If background and security checks indicate you may be inadmissible under INA 212(a) on a ground that cannot be waived and that would make you ineligible for SIJ-based adjustment of status, that would generally be a strong negative factor against granting deferred action.
We may decide, on a case-by-case basis, that other adverse factors weigh against granting deferred action, such as serious unresolved criminal charges that may result in an unwaivable inadmissibility ground that would render you ineligible for SIJ-based adjustment of status. We may also grant deferred action despite these concerns if case-specific circumstances warrant it.
Q10. What evidence will you rely on when considering deferred action?
A10. We will weigh positive and negative factors on a case-by-case basis to determine whether to grant deferred action. An approved SIJ petition is a particularly strong positive discretionary factor.
We will not issue a request for evidence (RFE) or notice of intent to deny (NOID) in the context of SIJ deferred action determinations.
Q11. How do you handle deferred action if I am in removal proceedings, and I have SIJ classification? Many SIJs have approved Form I-360 petitions and are still in removal proceedings. Some file Form I-485 before their priority date is current because certain judges allow or require it. And some file Form I-485 while their priority date is current, but the date retrogresses.
Will you grant deferred action if I am in removal proceedings with an approved SIJ Form I-360?

Yes, we may grant deferred action to SIJ-classified individuals without a current visa number who are in removal proceedings.
I am in removal proceedings. Will you consider prioritizing my case?

We will consider deferred action for SIJ-classified noncitizens as quickly and efficiently as possible. We do not presently have a way to expedite review if an individual is in removal proceedings.
I am in removal proceedings and filed Form I-485. Will you still grant me deferred action?

If you are an SIJ-classified noncitizen in removal proceedings, and you have a Form I-485 pending with the U.S. Department of Justice, Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR), we will only consider deferred action if a visa number in the EB-4 category is not currently available. Note that if you have a pending Form I-485, you are eligible for work authorization under 8 C.F.R. 274.12(c)(9).
My removal proceedings were terminated in immigration court. Will you still consider me for deferred action?

Yes, if your removal proceedings were terminated in immigration court, we may still consider you for SIJ deferred action, if you are otherwise eligible.
Q12. If I submitted a Form I-485 application, but you rejected my application due to a change in the visa bulletin, will you still consider me for deferred action?
A12. If you do not have an approved Form I-485 and an immigrant visa number is not available, we may consider you for SIJ deferred action. A rejected Form I-485 will not affect our consideration of SIJ deferred action.
Q13. Do I need to request you renew my SIJ deferred action, or will you automatically consider renewing it?
A13. We may consider a request to renew your SIJ deferred action if you remain ineligible to apply for adjustment of status because an immigrant visa number is not immediately available. You may submit a deferred action renewal request to us 150 days before your deferred action expires. Renewal requests are subject to the same guidance in the USCIS Policy Manual regarding eligibility and adjudication for an initial grant of SIJ deferred action.
We will soon publish more information regarding renewals for SIJ deferred action.
Q14. The Policy Manual says USCIS authorizes deferred action for 4 years. Will all grants of deferred action to SIJ recipients be for 4 years? Will employment authorization based on SIJ deferred action also be valid for 4 years?
A14. We will grant deferred action for up to 4 years. If you receive deferred action, you may obtain employment authorization for the period of deferred action. This means that if you receive employment authorization following a grant of deferred action, your employment authorization will expire the same day your deferred action expires.
Q15. What types of detention qualify as “immigration detention,” as referenced in footnote 29 of the SIJ Deferred Action Policy Manual Update?
A15. Immigration detention as referenced in footnote 29 of Volume 6, Part J, Chapter 4 of the USCIS Policy Manual refers to detention with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). It does not include custody under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) for unaccompanied minors.
Q16. If I receive deferred action under this policy, will I be eligible for advance parole?
A16. No, SIJ-classified noncitizens with deferred action under this policy are not eligible for advance parole.
Q17. If you deny or terminate my deferred action, can I ask you to reconsider? If I believe USCIS made a mistake in my deferred action adjudication, what is the best way to ask USCIS to review it?
A17. Because deferred action is by its nature an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and not a benefit, the agency does not have a process for you to file an administrative appeal or a motion to reopen or to reconsider. However, you may contact the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283 if you have a question about your deferred action determination.
Q18. When should I submit a status inquiry for the deferred action adjudication on a case that already has an approved Form I-360? Can I submit this inquiry online?
A18. For all previously approved SIJ-based Forms I-360, we will decide whether to grant deferred action as efficiently as possible. Our decision will be available on Case Status Online, and we will mail an amended Form I-797, Notice of Action, to you and your attorney of record. You may also contact the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283 to inquire about the status of a deferred action determination.
Q19. When SIJ-classified noncitizens have a Notice to Appear (NTA) that has not been filed with immigration court, do you cancel that NTA after you approve their Form I-360 and grant deferred action?
II. Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) Based on SIJ Deferred Action
Q20. Is there a fee to file a Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, based on deferred action through SIJ?
A20. If you file Form I-765, you must include the correct fee or a Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver. To request a fee waiver for Form I-765 when seeking an EAD based on SIJ deferred action, follow the same instructions for a fee waiver for an SIJ-based Form I-485.
This means that when you request a fee waiver, you should include evidence that you were approved or filed for SIJ classification (for example, Form I-360 or a copy of Form I-797, Notice of Action, for Form I-360) together with your Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver.
Q21. Can I submit my Form I-765 application together with my Form I-360 petition?
A21. No. You can only file Form I-765 after you have received deferred action.
We receive and process SIJ-based Forms I-360 and Forms I-765 based on SIJ deferred action through different workstreams, and different officers in separate divisions adjudicate them. Because of this, it is not practical to accept and adjudicate them together. If we did, the processing times for both forms would increase.
Q22. Where do I submit my Form I-765 based on deferred action through SIJ?
A22. Depending on your state of residence, file Form I-765 with the Chicago Lockbox or the Phoenix Lockbox, Attn: I-765 C14.
You can find more information on our Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization page.
Q23. If an applicant’s physical address and mailing address are in different states, which Lockbox should they use to file Form I-765? For example, if they physically reside in Missouri but they use their attorney’s address in California as their safe or alternate mailing address, should they file their Form I-765 with the Chicago Lockbox or the Phoenix Lockbox?
A23. You should file with the Lockbox for the location where you physically reside. If you prefer to receive correspondence at another address, such as your attorney’s address, you may list an alternate mailing address in the “U.S. Mailing Address” field on Form I-765.
Q24. I have an approved SIJ Form I-360 and am subject to the visa backlog. I filed a Form I-765 under category (c)(11) that is still pending, arguing that because I was paroled, I was eligible for an EAD. What will happen to that Form I-765?
A24. We will not convert the Form I-765 you filed under category (c)(11). If we grant you deferred action, you must file a new Form I-765, indicating category (c)(14), to receive employment authorization under deferred action. You must file Form I-765 with the correct fee, or with Form I-912 if you are seeking a fee waiver.
Q25. How will you determine “economic necessity” for work authorization under category (c)(14) based on SIJ deferred action? Will you prevent children too young to work from obtaining EADs?
A25. We will presume economic necessity based on an approved SIJ-based Form I-360. We do not require Form I-765WS, Worksheet, to determine economic necessity.
There is no age requirement to file Form I-765; even those too young to work may seek an EAD. An EAD may serve as a form of government-issued identification, in addition to granting authorization to work lawfully.
Q26. Can I submit Form I-765 if I see a grant of deferred action on USCIS Case Status Online, even if I have not received the notice in the mail?
A26. Yes, you may submit Form I-765 based on a grant of deferred action as indicated on Case Status Online.
Q27. Is there any way to expedite Form I-765 for an SIJ-classified individual granted deferred action who is experiencing extreme poverty or other emergency circumstances?
A27. We will consider expedite requests on a case-by-case basis under the criteria in the USCIS Policy Manual at Vol. 1, Part 1, Chap. 5, Requests to Expedite Applications or Petitions. Find more information on the How to Make an Expedite Request webpage.
Q28. I do not have a government-issued photo ID. If I am filing Form I-765 based on SIJ deferred action, can I use the ORR Verification of Release Form as a form of identification?
A28. Yes, the ORR Verification of Release form is a valid form of government identification when you are filing for an EAD based on SIJ deferred action. We have given our officers guidance to this effect, consistent with 8 CFR 204.11(d)(2).
Q29. How do I reschedule my biometrics appointment?
A29. You may contact the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283 to request that USCIS reschedule your biometrics appointment.
Q30. What forms of identification are acceptable at the Application Support Center (ASC) appointment for biometrics submission?
A30. We know that some SIJ petitioners and recipients may not have official government-issued photo identification but may have other forms of identification. A juvenile court-issued order citing the SIJ petitioner or recipient as the subject of the order is typically enough to verify identity. The order does not need to include a photograph of the juvenile. The ORR Verification of Release form is also a valid form of government identification.
III. Correspondence/Updating Addresses
Q31. If USCIS grants my deferred action, how will you notify me? In writing?
A31. If we grant you SIJ deferred action, we will issue a Form I- 797, Notice of Action, containing either an initial or amended approval of your Form I-360, together with the grant of deferred action. We also will update Case Status Online. You can access your Case Status Online information by entering the receipt number for your Form I-360.
If a Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, is on file for a Form I-360, we will send a courtesy notice to the attorney or accredited representative.
Q32. What is the best way to make sure you have my updated address?
A32. To update your mailing address, file Form AR-11, Alien’s Change of Address Card, online at USCIS.gov using the Change of Address page or mail Form AR- 11 to:
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Citizenship and Immigration Services
Attn: Change of Address
1344 Pleasants Drive
Harrisonburg, VA 22801
Q33. If I have already received SIJ classification and don't have a Form I-360 pending, what is the best way to ask that documents related to deferred action go to my safe mailing address?
A33. Safe mailing addresses are for those protected under the confidentiality provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1367 (petitioners and recipients of U nonimmigrant status, T nonimmigrant status, or relief under the Violence Against Women Act).
Although petitioners and recipients of SIJ classification are not covered by the 8 U.S.C. 1367 protections, SIJ petitioners may ask USCIS to use an alternate address for mail correspondence by entering an alternate address in Part 1, question 7, on Form I- 360. If the alternate address you provided on Form I-360 is still your preferred address, you do not need to update your address with USCIS.
If you have already been approved for SIJ classification and would like to update your alternate mailing address with USCIS, you may list the alternate address in the “Mailing Address” field on Form AR-11, Alien’s Change of Address Card.
Q34. What is the best way to communicate with USCIS about my SIJ case, including issues related to deferred action or long processing times?
A34. Generally, for all matters related to an SIJ-based Form I-360, you may call the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283. We have discontinued the SIJ NBC email box for general inquiries, but if you call the Contact Center, that will generate an internally trackable inquiry that will go to the NBC for resolution. However, before you call the Contact Center, you may also check your Case Status Online on USCIS.gov.
Q35. If I call the Contact Center, and I need to send a document to USCIS, will you follow up with me by email, so I can email that document?
A35. We generally cannot accept documents via email. If you need to submit documents to respond to (for example) a Contact Center request, a Request for Evidence, or a Notice of Intent to Deny, please follow the instructions provided on how to transmit the requested information.
If you need to submit documents related to your SIJ Form I-360 that are not in response to a request from USCIS, please mail them to the address below. Be sure to include your name, date of birth, A-Number, and receipt number. Please mail them to:
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Citizenship and Immigration Services
National Benefits Center, Overland Park
Attn: Special Immigrant Juvenile
P.O. Box 25920
Overland Park, KS 66225
Q36. I filed my SIJ-based Form I-485 with the immigration court, and the court terminated my removal proceedings. How do I transfer my case to USCIS?
A36. If the immigration court terminated or dismissed your removal proceedings so that USCIS can adjudicate your Form I-485, ICE counsel should forward your A-File to the appropriate USCIS office to adjudicate your adjustment application. You may also call the USCIS Contact Center to request that USCIS transfer a Form I-485 you initially filed with the immigration court so that we can adjudicate your application. After we receive your request, our Contact Center staff will verify that removal proceedings are terminated and then will refer your request to the adjudicating office. We may also send you a Request for Evidence to obtain a copy of your Form I-485 and other supporting documents if these documents are not in your A-File.
For additional information, please go to the Immigration Benefits in EOIR Removal Proceedings page.
Q37. I filed my SIJ-based Form I-485 with USCIS, but it was administratively closed for lack of jurisdiction because I was still in removal proceedings before the immigration court. The immigration court has now dismissed or terminated my proceedings. How do I reopen my Form I-485 with USCIS?
A37. Following termination of removal proceedings, you may call the USCIS Contact Center to request reopening of a Form I-485 that was filed with USCIS. (The receipt number will start with “MSC.”) The Contact Center will notify the adjudicating office, which will issue a Request for Evidence to obtain a copy of the order terminating removal proceedings, a copy of the Form I-485, and supporting documents, or other information, as required.
For additional information, please go to the Immigration Benefits in EOIR Removal Proceedings page.
IV. SIJ Final Rule
Q38. Given the recission of automatic revocation if an applicant is married after Form I-360 application was approved, are there any consequences related to Form I-360 approval if I get married?
A38. If you get married before your Form I-360 is approved, you are ineligible for SIJ classification under 8 CFR §204.11(b)(2), which provides that a petitioner must be “unmarried at the time of filing and adjudication.” To be eligible for SIJ classification, you must remain unmarried at the time of filing and adjudication of the Form I-360. However, if you marry after we approve your Form I-360, but before you adjust status to lawful permanent resident, we will no longer automatically revoke your Form I-360 petition.
Q39. Under the final rule, if my priority date is not current, and I got married before the rule became final, can I adjust status when my priority date is current, even though I married before this rule was published?
A39. You may apply for SIJ-based adjustment of status if your SIJ approval has not been revoked and you are otherwise eligible.
Q40. Under the new SIJ regulations, if I married after you approved my Form I-360 petition, I am still eligible to apply to adjust status. If I get married after I file Form I-485, and my Form I-485 was pending before April 7, 2022, when the SIJ rule went into effect, will you still adjudicate my pending Form I-485 under the new regulations?
A40. Yes. If your SIJ approval has not been revoked and you are otherwise eligible, we will adjudicate your pending Form I-485 under the new regulations.
Q41. Because marriage no longer results in automatic revocation of Form I-360 approval, do I need to update USCIS about a marriage that occurred after you approved my Form I-360?
A41. No. You do not need to update USCIS if you get married after we approve your Form I-360.
Q42. How do I know if my SIJ classification was automatically revoked?
A42. If the facts of a case trigger an automatic revocation under 8 CFR 204.11(j), we will issue a Notice of Automatic Revocation to you and to your attorney of record.
Q43. Do I have to keep the guardianship or custodial relationship with my guardian or custodial parent during the entire process, including Form I-485 processing?
A43. If you leave a court-ordered placement, that will not, by itself, affect your SIJ eligibility. However, in general, you must remain under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court at the time of the filing and adjudication of your SIJ-based Form I-360, with some exceptions. If you are no longer under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for a reason related to your underlying eligibility for SIJ classification, you may no longer be eligible for SIJ classification. This may include cases in which you are no longer under the jurisdiction of the court because:
The court vacated or terminated its determinations that made you eligible because of subsequent evidence or information that invalidated the determinations; or
The court reunited you with the parent the court previously said you could not reunite with because of abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis under state law.

We will not re-adjudicate Form I-360 when we adjudicate Form I-485. However, an approved Form I-360 is automatically revoked as of the date of the approval if either of the following circumstances occur before we issue a decision on Form I-485:
Reunification of the petitioner with 1 or both parents by virtue of a juvenile court order, where a juvenile court previously said reunification with that parent, or both parents, was not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis under state law; or
Reversal by the juvenile court of the determination that it would not be in the petitioner’s best interest to be returned to the petitioner’s, or the petitioner’s parents’, country of nationality or last habitual residence.

Q44. If I obtain a juvenile court order in the state where I live and move to another state before you approve my Form I-360, do I need a new juvenile court order in the new state?
A44. A juvenile court order does not necessarily terminate because you move to another court’s jurisdiction. In general, a court maintains jurisdiction when it orders the juvenile placed in a different state or makes a custody determination and the juvenile and the legal custodian relocate to a new jurisdiction. You only need a new juvenile court order if the original juvenile court order is no longer valid or in effect, unless the order terminated because you aged out of the juvenile court jurisdiction or a child welfare permanency goal was reached, such as adoption.
If the original order is terminated because you move, but another order is issued in a new jurisdiction, we consider the dependency or custody to have continued through the time of adjudication of the SIJ petition, even if there is a lapse between the court orders.
V. Filing, Processing Times, Waivers, and Data
Q45. Where can I find information and data relating to SIJ classification?
A45. For recent engagements, policy updates, and other information, please visit USCIS’ Electronic Reading Room. For general data and statistics, please visit USCIS’ Immigration and Citizenship Data page.
For additional information on SIJ classification and related adjustment of status, please visit the USCIS Policy Manual at Volume 6, Part J: Special Immigrant Juveniles, and Volume 7, Part F, Chapter 7: Special Immigrant Juvenile Adjustment.
Q46. What efforts has USCIS made to meet the 180-day adjudication deadline for SIJ Forms I-360?
A46. USCIS works hard to issue decisions on properly filed petitions for SIJ classification within 180 days. We have taken several steps to achieve this goal, including increasing the number of officers adjudicating SIJ Form I-360 petitions, reviewing workflow process points to identify efficiencies, and shifting SIJ-based Form I-485 adjudication to field offices so that the National Benefits Center has increased capacity to focus on the SIJ-based Form I-360.
Q47. Can USCIS allow SIJ-eligible noncitizens to file Form I-360 electronically, given age-out issues? If not, can you use the mailbox rule rather than the receipt rule to ensure that individuals aging out do not lose the opportunity to receive SIJ classification because of mailing issues?
A47. At this time, you cannot file an SIJ-based Form I-360 electronically. However, we understand the challenges related to filing and age-out issues for the SIJ Form I-360, and we recently instituted flexibilities to address this issue. First, in March 2023, we updated the USCIS Policy Manual to address situations when the last day to file a benefit request (for example, the day before an SIJ-eligible noncitizen turns 21) or respond to a USCIS action falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday. In these situations, we will consider a filing or response submitted on paper timely if we receive it by the end of the next business day. Second, to help petitioners file their SIJ Form I-360 before their 21st birthday, USCIS will allow petitioners to file Form I-360 in person at a USCIS field office within 2 weeks before they turn 21. For more information, see the Special Immigrant Juveniles page.
Q48. Does USCIS require a Form I-601 waiver for SIJs with prior removal orders?
A48. If we have jurisdiction over your application for adjustment of status because you are an arriving alien, and there is an unexecuted final removal order, we will request a Form I-601, Application for Waiver of Inadmissibility, for an inadmissibility ground that may be waived under INA 245(h), relating to inadmissibility grounds that apply to SIJs."

Employment-Based Immigration: Third Preference EB-3,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-third-preference-eb-3,"
You may be eligible for this immigrant visa preference category if you are a skilled worker, professional, or other worker.
“Skilled workers” are persons whose jobs require a minimum of 2 years training or experience, not of a temporary or seasonal nature. The skilled worker must meet the educational, training, or experience requirements of the job opportunity. Relevant post-secondary education may be considered as training.
“Professionals” are persons whose job requires at least a U.S. baccalaureate or foreign equivalent degree and are a member of the professions.
The “other workers” subcategory is for persons performing unskilled labor requiring less than 2 years training or experience, not of a temporary or seasonal nature.

You must be able to demonstrate that you possess at least 2 years of job experience, education, or training that meets the job requirements specified on the labor certification.
Relevant post-secondary education may be considered as training.
You must be performing work for which qualified workers are not available in the United States.

You must demonstrate that you possess a U.S. baccalaureate or foreign equivalent degree, and that a baccalaureate degree is the normal requirement for entry into the occupation.
You must be performing work for which qualified workers are not available in the United States.
Education and experience may not be substituted for a baccalaureate degree.
You must meet any other requirements specified on the labor certification.

You must demonstrate the ability to perform unskilled labor (requiring less than 2 years training or experience), that is not of a temporary or seasonal nature.
You must be performing work for which qualified workers are not available in the United States.

ALERT: New U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Approved English Proficiency Tests and Scores.

New U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Approved English Proficiency Tests and Scores.
Noncitizens seeking admission as a nonimmigrant or immigrant primarily to perform labor as a health care worker, other than as a physician, are not admissible to the United States unless they present certification from a USCIS-approved credentialing organization verifying that they have met the minimum requirements for education, training, licensure, experience, and English proficiency in their field.
Specifically, the certification verifies the noncitizen has:
Are comparable with that required for an American health care worker of the same type;
Are authentic and, in the case of a license, unencumbered; and
Meet all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for admission into the United States (this verification is not binding on DHS, which makes its own admissibility determination).

A predictor test (if the majority of States licensing the profession in which the noncitizen intends to work recognize a test predicting a worker’s success on the profession’s licensing or certification examination), or
The occupation’s actual licensing or certification examination.

Health Care Occupations Requiring a Certification
The following health care occupations require a certification under 8 CFR 212.15(c):
Licensed practical nurses, licensed vocational nurses, and registered nurses;
Physical therapists;
Occupational therapists;
Speech-language pathologists and audiologists;
Medical technologists (also known as clinical laboratory scientists);
Medical technicians (also known as clinical laboratory technicians); and
Physician assistants.

Please note: Nurses have an alternative certification process. A foreign nurse may present a certified statement from the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS) or an approved equivalent independent credentialing organization if it verifies that the foreign nurse:
See section 212(r) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).
Providing Valid Health Care Worker Certification
Noncitizen workers in an affected health care occupation must present a valid health care worker certification each time they:
Seek admission into the United States,
Change status,
Extend status, or
Adjust status.

The certification requirement is no longer applicable once the worker is a lawful permanent resident.
Organizations Authorized to Issue Health Care Worker Certifications
The following organizations are authorized to issue certifications for the following health care occupations:
The Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS) is authorized to issue certifications to all 7 health care occupations.
The National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT) is authorized to issue certifications for occupational therapists.
The Foreign Credentialing Commission on Physical Therapy (FCCPT) is authorized to issue certifications for physical therapists.
Josef Silny & Associates, Inc. (JSA) is authorized to issue certifications for nurses.

These organizations are approved by the Secretary of Homeland Security in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. See Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135.
Submitting Health Care Worker Certifications
Immigrant petitions:
For immigrant petitions, there is a two-step process after obtaining a labor certification from the Department of Labor, if applicable (employers seeking to hire professional nurses or physical therapists apply for Schedule A, Group I certification by filing an uncertified labor certification and visa petition directly with USCIS):
Step 1: Generally, the Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker, is first filed by an employer on behalf of the prospective noncitizen worker. In adjudicating the I-140 petition, USCIS reviews all eligibility requirements. In addition to evaluating the petitioner’s continuing ability to pay the proffered wage, this review includes examination of the beneficiary’s qualifications (for example, education, experience, licensure, and/or training as set forth in the job opportunity’s requirements on the labor certification and the preference category and Schedule A Group I requirements as applicable).
For physical therapists, 20 CFR 656.15(c)(1) requires that the employer include evidence to establish that the beneficiary currently has (and had at the time of filing) a permanent license to practice in the state of intended employment or, in the alternative, a letter or statement, signed by an authorized state physical therapy licensing official in the state of intended employment with the petition submission to USCIS. The letter must confirm that the noncitizen is qualified to take that state’s written licensing examination for physical therapists.
For nurses, 20 CFR 656.15(c)(2) requires that the employer include CGFNS certification, a full and unrestricted (permanent) license to practice nursing in the state of intended employment, or passage of NCLEX-RN as part of the petition submission to USCIS.
Schedule A Group I applications require other evidentiary submissions such as a prevailing wage determination covering the proffered position in the geographic location where the work will be performed and a notice of filing either posted at the facility or location of the employment or, if applicable, sent to the appropriate bargaining unit.
Step 2: If the noncitizen worker is in the United States, they may file a Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. It is only upon the filing of an I-485 that the health care worker certification is required and will be used to determine admissibility for adjustment of status. While the noncitizen worker may receive interim benefits such as a work permit and travel permission with the favorable exercise of discretion, the filing and adjudication of the Form I-485 is dependent upon an immigrant visa number being available and the validity of the underlying visa petition.
If the noncitizen worker is living outside the United States or living in the United States, but chooses to apply for an immigrant visa abroad, USCIS will send the approved petition to the Department of State’s (DOS) National Visa Center (NVC), where it will remain until an immigrant visa number is available. The noncitizen worker must present the health care certification to the consular officer at the time the visa is issued.
Nonimmigrant petitions:
For nonimmigrant petitions seeking admission, an extension of stay, or a change of status, there are two considerations:
Consideration 1: The petitioner files a Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, or Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker, for approval of the noncitizen worker’s classification as a nonimmigrant. In adjudicating the petition for the classification requested, USCIS reviews all eligibility requirements, including licensure, if applicable. The health care certification must be presented at the time of visa issuance or admission (if the noncitizen worker is visa-exempt).
Consideration 2: If the noncitizen is already in the United States, the Form I-129 may also serve as a petition to extend the period of the noncitizen's authorized stay or to change their status. Although the Form I-129 petition classification may be approved, the request for an extension of stay or change of status will be denied if the petitioner fails to submit the health care worker certification required by law. See 8 CFR 212.15(a).
Please note: USCIS does not accept a health care worker certification as the sole evidence that the foreign worker has met the minimum requirement for the given position and is, therefore, eligible for the requested visa classification. While the health care worker certification verifies the worker’s credentials for admissibility into the United States under INA 212(a)(5)(C), it is not binding on DHS. See 8 CFR 212.15(f)(1)(iii).
Role of Certification in the USCIS Adjudication Process
USCIS uses the certification to verify the worker’s credentials for admissibility into the United States. See INA 212(a)(5)(C). Additionally, USCIS must ensure that the health care worker meets educational requirements for the classification and any applicable licensure requirements. In reviewing the worker’s educational documents, USCIS considers the education credential evaluator’s opinion in conjunction with a review of the noncitizen’s relevant education credentials (if submitted), and other available credible material regarding the equivalency of the education credentials to college degrees obtained in the United States.
In the course of the adjudication, USCIS may refer to educational equivalency resources to clarify an individual’s academic credentials, although information from such sources is not binding. Note that even if it is established s that a bachelor’s degree from the home country of the noncitizen worker represents a level of education that is equivalent to a bachelor's degree in the United States, it is possible that the degree would not qualify the individual for the EB-2 advanced degree category unless they also have five years of post-baccalaureate progressive experience. In such cases, USCIS may issue a Request for Evidence asking the petitioner to provide evidence demonstrating that the beneficiary has either a United States advanced degree or foreign equivalent degree or has a United States bachelor’s degree or a foreign equivalent degree, and evidence in the form of letters from current or former employer(s) showing that the beneficiary has at least five years of progressive post-baccalaureate experience in the specialty.
USCIS Criteria for Educational Equivalency
The USCIS criteria for educational equivalency are explained in the eligibility requirements for the specific nonimmigrant or immigrant classification.
For instance, employment-based second preference immigrant petitions (EB-2) for members of the professions holding an advanced degree must establish, among other requirements, that the worker has met the minimum requirements for the classification as well as the position. Specifically, the beneficiary must have an advanced degree, which is a U.S. academic or professional degree, or it may be a foreign equivalent degree above that of baccalaureate. See 8 CFR 204.5(k)(2). If the labor certification lists an advanced degree as acceptable for the position, the educational requirement may include a U.S. bachelor’s degree or a foreign equivalent degree followed by five years of progressive experience. See 8 CFR 204.5(k)(2). If a doctoral degree is customarily required by the specialty, the noncitizen must have a United States doctorate or a foreign equivalent degree. See 8 CFR 204.5(k)(2).
To demonstrate that the noncitizen is a professional holding an advanced degree, the petition must be accompanied by:
(A) An official academic record showing that the noncitizen has a United States advanced degree or a foreign equivalent degree; or
(B) An official academic record showing that the noncitizen has a United States baccalaureate degree or a foreign equivalent degree, and evidence in the form of letters from current or former employer(s) showing that the noncitizen has at least five years of progressive post-baccalaureate experience in the specialty. See 8 CFR 204.5(k)(3)(i).

Health Care Credentialing Organizations’ Criteria for Educational Equivalency
The credentialing organizations’ educational equivalency criteria are also guided by the statutory and regulatory requirements for the particular nonimmigrant or immigrant classification. The certification process sets guidelines for educational equivalency that focus on the:
Verification of the noncitizen’s education;
Verification of all licenses to practice in the occupation; and
Compliance with English language proficiency requirements.

The credentialing organizations must evaluate the noncitizen’s education to ensure that it:
Is comparable to a U.S. education,
Meets the minimum educational requirements for licensure (in the State of intended employment), and
Meets the minimum educational requirements for the requested classification.

However, the credentialing organization’s evaluation is not binding on DHS. See 8 CFR 212.15(f)(1)(iii).
Renewing the Health Care Certification
A foreign worker’s certification must be used for any admission into the United States, extension or change of status within the United States, or adjustment of status within five years of the date that it is issued. See 8 CFR 212.15(n)(4). For this reason, the certification is only valid for five years. This ensures that the individual continues to meet the regulatory requirements for issuance of the certification. Therefore, if the foreign worker has not used the certification because they have not been admitted to the United States or adjusted their status within five years of when the certification was obtained, a new certification is required at the time they seek adjustment of status, to change or extend status with USCIS, or when seeking visa issuance by DOS or admission at the port of entry.
Please note that certification does not remove requirements for licensure, if applicable.
However, the credentialing organization must have a formal policy for renewing the certification if an individual’s original certification expires before admission to the United States or application for adjustment of status. See 8 CFR 212.15(k)(4)(viii). The credentialing organization is limited to updating information on licensure to determine the existence of any adverse actions and the need to re-establish English competency, and therefore does not re-evaluate the educational credentials when renewing the certification."
Employment-Based Immigration: Second Preference EB-2,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-second-preference-eb-2,"
You may be eligible for an employment-based, second preference visa if you are a member of the professions holding an advanced degree or its equivalent, or a person who has exceptional ability. Below are the occupational categories and requirements:
Documentation, such as an official academic record showing that you have a U.S. advanced degree or a foreign equivalent degree, or an official academic record showing that you have a U.S. baccalaureate degree or a foreign equivalent degree and letters from current or former employers showing that you have at least 5 years of progressive post-baccalaureate work experience in the specialty.
If a doctoral degree is customarily required, you must have a United States doctorate or foreign equivalent degree
Official academic record showing that you have a degree, diploma, certificate, or similar award from a college, university, school, or other institution of learning relating to your area of exceptional ability
Letters from current or former employers documenting at least 10 years of full-time experience in your occupation
A license to practice your profession or certification for your profession or occupation
Evidence that you have commanded a salary or other remuneration for services that demonstrates your exceptional ability
Membership in a professional association(s)
Recognition for your achievements and significant contributions to your industry or field by your peers, government entities, professional or business organizations
Other comparable evidence of eligibility is also acceptable.

Labor Certification and Ability to Pay. Employment-based, second-preference petitions must usually be accompanied by a certified Application for Permanent Employment Certification from the Department of Labor (DOL) on ETA Form 9089, however, DOL provides for a blanket (Schedule A) certification in certain situations. As part of the application process, your employer must be able to demonstrate an ability to pay the offered wage as of the priority date and continuing until you obtain lawful permanent residence status. Your employer may use an annual report, federal income tax return, or audited financial statement to demonstrate a continuing ability to pay your wage. Finally, you may request a waiver of this requirement in the national interest through the petition filed with USCIS. Because the national interest waiver waives the job offer, you do not need to demonstrate an employer’s ability to pay a wage.
** Factors USCIS Considers for National Interest Waiver
The proposed endeavor has both substantial merit and national importance.
You are well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor.
On balance, it would be beneficial to the United States to waive the requirements of a job offer, and thus the labor certification.

For more guidance on these factors in general and how USCIS considers them for those pursuing endeavors in STEM and entrepreneurs, read our policy in section D of USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 6, Part F, Chapter 5, Advanced Degree or Exceptional Ability.
For more information on filing fees, see the Filing Fees page.
If your I-140 petition is approved, your spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 may be eligible to apply for admission to the United States in E-21 and E-22 immigrant status, respectively.

ALERT: On March 22, 2023, the Department of State posted the April 2023 Visa Bulletin, as well as a Federal Register Notice (PDF) explaining certain changes to the Final Action Dates and Dates for Filing for the Employment-Based Fourth Preference Immigrant Visa Category.
Approximately 140,000 immigrant visas are available each fiscal year for noncitizens (and their spouses and children) who seek to immigrate based on their job skills. If you have the right combination of skills, education, and/or work experience and are otherwise eligible, you may be able to live permanently in the United States. The five employment-based immigrant visa preferences (categories) are listed below.
We are prioritizing efforts to ensure we use as many available employment-based visas (PDF, 1015.37 KB) as possible this fiscal year.
We urge anyone who may be eligible for an employment-based adjustment of status to file their adjustment of status application, accompanied by a valid Form I-693, Report of Medical Examination and Vaccination Record, as soon as possible.
An unusually high number of employment-based immigrant visa numbers were available in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021. Despite pandemic-related capacity restrictions, USCIS was able to increase processing and approve more than 175,000 employment-based adjustment of status applications. While this was an increase of more than 50% above our typical workload, 65,000 available employment-based visa numbers remained unused at the end of FY 2021. We have already taken a number of steps this fiscal year to help ensure that future immigrant visa allotments do not go unused (PDF, 1015.37 KB).
Frequently asked questions are available on the Fiscal Year 2022 Employment-Based Adjustment of Status FAQs page.
Some immigrant visa preferences require you to already have a job offer from a U.S. employer. This employer will be considered your sponsor. For some visa categories, before the U.S. employer can submit an immigration petition to USCIS, the employer must obtain an approved labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). The DOL labor certification verifies the following:
There are insufficient available, qualified, and willing U.S. workers to fill the position being offered at the prevailing wage
Hiring a foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers

TN NAFTA Professionals,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/tn-nafta-professionals,"
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) created special economic and trade relationships for the United States, Canada and Mexico. The TN nonimmigrant classification permits qualified Canadian and Mexican citizens to seek temporary entry into the United States to engage in business activities at a professional level.

Among the types of professionals who are eligible to seek admission as TN nonimmigrants are accountants, engineers, lawyers, pharmacists, scientists, and teachers. You may be eligible for TN nonimmigrant status, if:

You are a citizen of Canada or Mexico;
Your profession qualifies under the regulations;
The position in the United States requires a NAFTA professional;
You have a prearranged full-time or part-time job with a U.S. employer (but not self-employment - see documentation required below); and
You have the qualifications to practice in the profession in question.

Unlike Mexican citizens, Canadian citizens are generally eligible for admission as nonimmigrants without a visa.  The TN category, a nonimmigrant classification, simply reflects this general exemption from the visa requirement.  NAFTA governs which evidence is required to prove whether a Canadian or Mexican citizen is a professional in a qualifying profession.

If you are a Canadian citizen, then you are not required to apply for a TN visa at a U.S. consulate. 

You may establish eligibility for TN classification at the time you seek admission to the United States by presenting required documentation to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at certain CBP-designated U.S. ports of entry or at a designated pre-clearance/pre-flight inspection station. You must provide the following documentation to the CBP officer:

Proof of Canadian citizenship;
Letter from your prospective employer detailing items such as the professional capacity in which you will work in the United States, the purpose of your employment, your length of stay, and your educational qualifications; and
Credentials evaluation (if applicable), together with any applicable fees.

Please refer to CBP’s website for additional information and requirements for applying for admission to the United States.  If a CBP officer finds you eligible for admission, you will be admitted as a TN nonimmigrant. 

Alternatively, a prospective TN employer may choose to file on behalf of a Canadian citizen who is outside the United States by submitting Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker to USCIS.  Premium Processing Service is available.

If USCIS approves Form I-129, you, the prospective worker, may then apply to CBP for admission to the United States as a TN nonimmigrant by providing the following documentation to a CBP Officer at certain CBP-designated U.S. ports of entry or at a designated pre-clearance/pre-flight inspection station:

Proof of Canadian citizenship; and 
Approval Notice from USCIS for Form I-129.

In addition, when applying for admission, you should have in your possession a copy of the Form I-129, and all supporting documentation that was submitted to USCIS, to respond to questions about your eligibility.  You should also be prepared to pay any applicable inspection fees at the time you seek admission.  If a CBP officer finds you eligible for admission, you will be admitted as a TN nonimmigrant. 

If you are a Mexican citizen, then you are required to obtain a visa to enter the United States as a TN nonimmigrant. You should apply for a TN visa directly at a U.S. embassy or consulate in Mexico.  See the U.S. Department of State webpage, ""Mexican and Canadian NAFTA Professional Worker.""

Once you are approved for a TN visa, you may apply for admission at certain CBP-designated U.S. ports of entry or at a designated pre-clearance/pre-flight inspection station.  Please refer to CBP’s website for additional information and requirements for applying for admission to the United States.  If a CBP officer finds you eligible for admission, then you will be admitted as a TN nonimmigrant.  

Initial Period of Stay

Up to 3 years
        
If you wish to remain in the United States beyond your initial period of stay without first departing from the United States, you must seek an extension of stay. If you are in the United States, your employer may file Form I-129 on your behalf.

Alternatively, you may depart from the United States before the date your status expires, and then, once abroad, you may apply at a CBP-designated U.S. port of entry or at a designated pre-clearance/pre-flight inspection station using the same application and documentation procedures required at the time of your initial application for admission as a TN nonimmigrant.

Any accompanying or “following to join” spouse and children under the age of 21 may be eligible for TD nonimmigrant status.  Spouses and children are:

Not permitted to work while in the United States, but they are permitted to study.
Granted TD status for no longer than the period of time granted to the principal TN nonimmigrant.

See the table below for specific information on how to apply for TD nonimmigrant status.

If a Canadian or Mexican TN nonimmigrant applies for an extension of stay in the United States at the end of his or her period of admission or authorization as a TN, any eligible TD family member may also apply to extend their status without the need to travel abroad.

If a Mexican TD dependent wishes to travel abroad following approval of any such extension of stay and expiration of the TD visa, the family member will be required to apply for a new TD visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate before being permitted to return to the United States in TD status.
"
R-1 Nonimmigrant Religious Workers,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/r-1-nonimmigrant-religious-workers,"
Ministers and non-ministers in religious vocations and occupations may come to the U.S. temporarily for the purpose of performing religious work.
General Eligibility
An R-1 nonimmigrant is a noncitizen who is coming to the United States temporarily to work at least part time (an average of at least 20 hours per week) as a minister or in a religious vocation or occupation and be employed by a:
Non-profit religious organization in the United States;
Religious organization that is authorized by a group tax exemption holder to use its group tax exemption; or
Non-profit organization which is affiliated with a religious denomination in the United States.

To qualify, you must have been a member of a religious denomination having a bona fide non-profit religious organization in the United States for at least two years immediately before filing the petition.
Petition Process and Evidentiary Requirements
A prospective or existing U.S. employer must file Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, on behalf of a noncitizen seeking to enter the United States as a nonimmigrant minister, or a religious worker in a religious vocation or occupation.
If a petitioner believes that one of the eligibility requirements substantially burdens the organization’s exercise of religion, they may seek an exemption under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). A written request for the exemption should accompany the initial filing, and it must explain how the provision:
Requires participation in an activity prohibited by a sincerely held religious belief; or
Prevents participation in conduct motivated by a sincerely held religious belief.

The petitioner bears the burden of showing that it qualifies for a RFRA exemption and must support the request with relevant documentation. We will decide exemption requests on a case-by-case basis.
The petitioner must include evidence of eligibility for the classification sought. Both the petitioning organization and the religious worker must satisfy certain requirements, which are summarized below and discussed further in Volume 2, Part O, of the USCIS Policy Manual.
Proof of Tax-Exempt Status
If the petitioning organization has its own individual IRS 501(c)(3) letter, the petitioner must provide a currently valid determination letter from the IRS showing that the organization is tax-exempt. The IRS determination letter must be valid and cover the petitioning organization at the time the religious organization files Form I-129. A valid determination letter may include a letter that the IRS issued before the effective date of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or may be issued under subsequent Internal Revenue Code revisions.
If the organization is recognized as tax-exempt under a group tax exemption, the petitioner must provide a currently valid IRS group tax-exemption determination letter and documentation that the organization is covered under the group tax exemption. Examples include a:
Letter from the parent organization authorizing the petitioner to use its group tax exemption;
Directory for that organization listing the petitioner as a member of the group;
Membership listing on the parent organization’s website that confirms coverage under its exemption; or
Letter from the IRS confirming the coverage.

If the IRS determination letter does not identify the organization’s tax exemption as a religious organization, then the petitioner must submit evidence establishing the organization’s religious nature and purpose. This may include, but is not limited to, the entity’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, flyers, articles, brochures, or other literature that describes the religious purpose and nature of the organization.
If the organization is affiliated with the religious denomination, the petitioner must provide:
A currently valid determination letter from the IRS showing that the organization is tax-exempt;
Documentation that establishes the religious nature and purpose of the organization, including, but not limited to:
	A copy of the organizing instrument of the organization that specifies the purposes of the organization;
Organizational literature describing the religious purpose and nature of the activities of the organization; and

A religious denomination certification, included as part of the Form I-129, Supplement R, stating that the petitioning organization is affiliated with the religious denomination. The religious denomination certification should be signed by an organization other than the petitioning organization, and attest that the petitioning organization is part of the same religious denomination as the attesting organization.

A copy of the organizing instrument of the organization that specifies the purposes of the organization;
Organizational literature describing the religious purpose and nature of the activities of the organization; and

Proof of Salaried or Non-Salaried Compensation, or Self-Support
The petitioner must submit verifiable evidence showing how it intends to compensate the religious worker, including specific monetary or in-kind compensation, or how the R-1 nonimmigrant will be self-supporting as part of an established missionary program. Evidence of how the petitioner intends to provide salaried or non-salaried compensation may include:
Past evidence of compensation for similar positions;
Budgets showing monies set aside for salaries, or leases;
Evidence that the prospective employer will provide room and board to the religious worker; and
W-2 forms or certified tax returns.

If IRS documents are not available, the petitioner must explain why and provide comparable, verifiable documentation.
Self-support means that the position the beneficiary will hold is part of an established program for temporary, uncompensated missionary work, and part of a broader international program of missionary work the denomination sponsors. If the beneficiary will be self-supporting, the petitioner must provide:
Evidence demonstrating that the petitioner has an established program for temporary, uncompensated missionary work;
Evidence demonstrating that the denomination maintains missionary programs both in the United States and abroad;
Evidence of the beneficiary’s acceptance into the missionary program;
Evidence demonstrating the religious duties and responsibilities associated with the traditionally uncompensated missionary work; and
Copies of the beneficiary’s bank records, budgets documenting the sources of self-support (including personal or family savings, room and board with host families in the United States, or donations from the denomination’s churches) or other verifiable evidence acceptable to USCIS.

For additional information about USCIS policy related to the compensation requirements, see the USCIS Policy Manual.
Proof of Denominational Membership and Evidence Regarding the Prospective Position
The petitioner must submit:
Evidence that the religious worker is a member of a religious denomination having a bona fide non-profit religious organization in the United States for at least two years immediately before filing Form I-129; and
Evidence to establish that the religious worker is qualified to perform the duties of the offered position. If the religious worker will work as a minister, the petitioner must provide:
	A copy of the religious worker’s certificate of ordination or similar documents; and
Documents showing the religious denomination accepted the religious worker’s qualification as a minister, as well as evidence that they completed any course of prescribed theological education at an accredited theological institution normally required or recognized by that religious denomination. Include transcripts, curriculum, and documentation that establishes that the theological institution is accredited by the denomination


A copy of the religious worker’s certificate of ordination or similar documents; and
Documents showing the religious denomination accepted the religious worker’s qualification as a minister, as well as evidence that they completed any course of prescribed theological education at an accredited theological institution normally required or recognized by that religious denomination. Include transcripts, curriculum, and documentation that establishes that the theological institution is accredited by the denomination

If the denomination does not require a prescribed theological education, the petitioner must provide:
The religious denomination’s requirements for ordination to minister;
A list of duties performed by virtue of ordination;
The denomination’s levels of ordination, if any; and
Evidence the religious worker completed the denomination’s requirements for ordination.

Please remember to provide a duplicate copy of the Form I-129 and all supporting documents. Failure to submit duplicate copies may result in a delay in the issuance of a nonimmigrant visa abroad from the U.S. Department of State.
On-Site Inspections
Under the regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(r)(16), USCIS may conduct on-site inspections either before or after a final decision is made on the petition. If we perform an inspection before a final decision is made, successfully completing the inspection will be a condition for us approving your petition.
The religious organization must provide the physical address where the beneficiary will work, even if that address is not the same as the mailing address, so we may conduct a site inspection if we determine it is appropriate to verify information and supporting evidence in the petition.
In addition, we may inspect the beneficiary’s work location to verify the beneficiary’s work hours, compensation, and duties. We may also complete a post-adjudication inspection in cases of suspected non-compliance with the terms of the visa classification or where the petitioning entity has undergone substantial changes since its last filing. We closely monitor all on-site inspections to ensure program integrity and to prevent undue delays in the adjudication process.
Post -Petition Approval
After we approve your petition, the consular post determines whether you are eligible to receive the R-1 nonimmigrant visa. As with all individuals who appear at ports of entry, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) determines whether the beneficiary may be admitted to the United States. Visa exempt workers must present the original Form I-797, Notice of Action, at a port of entry, as evidence of an approved Form I-129. For more information on visa application processing and issuance fees, see the Department of State’s Temporary Worker Visas webpage.
Period of Stay
We may grant R-1 status for an initial period of admission for up to 30 months and subsequent extensions for up to an additional 30 months. Your total period of stay in the United States in R-1 classification cannot exceed five years (60 months). We only count time spent physically in the United States in valid R-1 status toward the maximum period of stay. See the USCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part O, Chapter 7.
If you obtain Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, from CBP with an initial period of admission beyond the regulatory maximum of 30 months, you should bring the error to the attention a CBP officer at the port of entry that issued the Form I-94, or the Deferred Inspection Office of CBP. Do not use Form I-102, Application for Replacement/Initial Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Document, to request that we correct a CBP error on Form I-94. We cannot correct the Form I-94. Neither you nor the petitioner will be penalized for the error. However, the error may affect your future immigration benefits if you exceed the statutory maximum of five years. Please visit cbp.gov for information on correcting a Form I-94 issued by CBP.
If your Form I-94 lists an initial period of admission longer than 30 months and you need to stay beyond 30 months, you may request an extension of stay before the end of that 30-month period of admission.
Before applying for a new nonimmigrant R-1 visa (with a new five-year maximum stay), you must have been physically present outside the United States for the immediate previous year. These time limitations do not apply to religious workers who did not reside continuously in the United States and whose employment in the United States was seasonal, intermittent or for a total of six months or less per year. The limitations also do not apply to religious workers who reside abroad and commute to the United States to work part time.
Dual Intent
Nonimmigrant religious workers must maintain the intent to depart the United States when their nonimmigrant stay expires. At the same time, we may not deny a nonimmigrant petition, application for initial admission, change of status, or extension of stay in R classification solely on the basis of a filed or an approved permanent labor certification application or immigrant visa petition.
Family of R-1 Visa Holders
An R-1 religious worker’s spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 may be eligible for R-2 classification. An R-2 dependent is not authorized to work based on this visa classification.
B-1 Visa Holders
Ministers and members of religious denominations seeking temporary admission to the United States for brief periods may be eligible to be admitted as B-1 business visitors if their activities are allowed under the B-1 nonimmigrant visitor category. See 8 CFR 214.2(b)(1). The Department of State governs the issuance of visas. For more information about the B-1 visa category and allowed B-1 activities, please refer to the Foreign Affairs Manual at 9 FAM 402.2-5(c)(1).
Notification of Termination of Employment
The petitioner must notify us within 14 days of any change in the nonimmigrant religious worker’s employment. For the religious worker to change employers, the new petitioner must file a new Form I-129, attestation, and supporting evidence.
Petitioners must also notify us of any R-1 employment terminations at one of the following addresses:
Email: cscr-1earlyterminationnotif@uscis.dhs.gov
Mail:
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services
California Service Center
Attn: BCU Section Chief
P.O. Box 30050
Laguna Niguel, CA 92607-3004
Change of Location of Employment
A change in location of employment may constitute a material change to the terms and conditions of employment as specified in the original approved R-1 petition. If there is a material change in the terms or conditions of employment (or the beneficiary’s eligibility), the petitioner may be required to file an amended petition and receive an approval before the beneficiary’s move to a new location of employment.
If it is anticipated that you will be moved between different locations within a larger organization, that organization should file the petition. For example, a minister may move from ministry to ministry within a denomination, including at a different or additional unit of the religious denomination if the petitioning organization oversees all of these locations.
The petitioning organization can file an amended petition, with fee, by checking Box F under Item 2 in Part 2 of Form I-129.
Green Cards

"
Q Cultural Exchange,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/q-cultural-exchange,"
There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons who want to participate in Exchange Visitor programs in the United States. The J nonimmigrant classification is for participants of exchange programs, designated by the Department of State, that are designed to promote educational and cultural exchanges between the United States and other countries. The Q nonimmigrant classification is for participants of international cultural exchange programs designated by the Department of Homeland Security. For more information on J Exchange Visitors, see the Department of State: Exchange Visitor (J) Visas page.
You may be eligible for Q-1 nonimmigrant classification if you are seeking to participate in an international cultural exchange program approved by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Q cultural exchange program is for the purpose of providing practical training and employment, and sharing the history, culture, and traditions of your home country with the United States.
For more information, see Volume 2, Part E of the USCIS Policy Manual. 

Eligibility Criteria
Only qualified employers who administer cultural exchange programs, or designated agents they employ on a permanent basis in an executive or managerial capacity, are allowed to petition for Q nonimmigrants. The purpose of the Q nonimmigrant visa classification is to facilitate the sharing of international cultures. It is an employment-oriented program, but a cultural element must be an essential and integral part of your duties. You must be:
At least 18 years old;
Qualified to perform the service, labor or training; and
Able to communicate effectively about the cultural attributes of your country to the American public.

Petition Process
The qualified employer, or a designated agent it employs on a permanent basis in an executive or managerial capacity, must file Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, with the USCIS office specified in the form instructions. In addition, along with the position description, the employer must submit evidence that it maintains an established international cultural exchange program. It may demonstrate this by submitting copies of brochures, curriculum, or other types of material that illustrate that the program’s cultural component is designed, on the whole, to exhibit or explain the attitude, customs, history, heritage, philosophy, traditions, and/or other cultural attributes (arts, literature, language) of the participant’s country of nationality. The employer must also submit evidence that the program activities take place in a school, museum, business or other establishment where the American public, or a segment of the public sharing a common cultural interest, is exposed to aspects of a foreign culture as part of a structured program.
In addition, the employer must establish that it:
Has designated a qualified employee to administer the program and serve as liaison with USCIS;
Is actively doing business in the United States;
Will offer the noncitizen wages and working conditions comparable to those accorded local workers similarly employed; and
Has the financial ability to compensate the participant(s), as shown by a copy of the employer's most recent annual report, business income tax return or other form of certified accountant's report.

Applying for a Visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate
Once the visa petition is approved, you can apply for a visa (if required) at a U.S. embassy or consulate. For more information on visa application processing and issuance fees, see the “Department of State, travel.state.gov” page.
Period of Stay/Extension of Stay
After you complete your Q cultural exchange program, you are afforded 30 days to depart the United States. You are required to spend 1 year outside the United States before you can apply for participation in an Q cultural exchange program again.
Family of Q Visa Holders
The Q nonimmigrant classification does not have a provision for any spouse or children to accompany or follow to join a Q-1 nonimmigrant. Therefore, any spouse or children wishing to enter the United States must qualify independently for a nonimmigrant classification."
P-3 Artist or Entertainer Coming to Be Part of a Culturally Unique Program,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/p-3-artist-or-entertainer-coming-to-be-part-of-a-culturally-unique-program,"

Please note that a petitioner who will be filing as an agent for multiple employers must establish that it is duly authorized to act as an agent. The required conditions can be found in the memorandum Requirements for Agents and Sponsors Filing as Petitioners for the O and P Visa Classifications.  (PDF, 790.07 KB)
Supporting Documents

Change of Employer
You may change employers, but only after your new employer has filed a new Form I-129 with USCIS requesting permission to employ you and extend your stay. You may not commence employment with the new employer until the Form I-129 has been approved.
Family of P-3 Visa Holders
Your spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 may obtain P-4 status. Your dependents may not engage in employment, but may attend school or college.

Essential support personnel who are an integral part of the performance of a P-3 artist or entertainer and who perform support services that cannot be readily performed by a U.S. worker, are eligible for P-3 classification. Support personnel may include coaches, scouts, trainers, and other team officials and referees.
The U.S. employer must file a separate Form I-129 for support personnel. The petition must include the following documents:
A consultation from an appropriate labor organization
A statement describing the support person’s prior and current essentially, critical skills, and experience with the P-3 artist or entertainer

P-2 Individual Performer or Part of a Group Entering to Perform Under a Reciprocal Exchange Program,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/p-2-individual-performer-or-part-of-a-group-entering-to-perform-under-a-reciprocal-exchange-program,"
The P-2 classification applies to you if you are coming temporarily to perform as an artist or entertainer, individually or as part of a group, who will perform under a reciprocal exchange program between an organization in the United States and an organization in another country.

For more information, see Volume 2, Part N of the USCIS Policy Manual.

You must be an artist entering the United States through a government recognized reciprocal exchange program. At the present time, five P-2 reciprocal agreements have been negotiated between the following organizations:

The American Federation of Musicians (U.S.) and the American Federation of Musicians (Canada);
Actor’s Equity Association (U.S.) and the Canadian Actors’ Equity Association;
Actor’s Equity Association (U.S.) and the British Actors’ Equity Association;
The International Council of Air Shows and the Canadian Air Show Association.
The Alliance of Canadian Cinema Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA) and the Screen Actor Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA).

If a reciprocal agreement is submitted other than these five, USCIS will review the agreement to determine if the agreement adheres to the regulatory standard.

In addition, you must possess skills comparable to those of the United States artists and entertainers taking part in the program outside the United States.

In order for you to qualify for a P-2 Visa, a sponsoring labor organization in the United States, or your U.S. employer must file Form I-129, Petition for a Non-Immigrant Worker. For more information about the Form 129, see the “Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker” page.

Please note that a petitioner who will be filing as an agent for multiple employers must establish that it is duly authorized to act as an agent. The required conditions can be found in the memorandum “Requirements for Agents and Sponsors Filing as Petitioners for the O and P Visa Classifications.” (PDF, 790.07 KB)

The Form I-129 must include the following documents:

Written consultation by an appropriate labor organization
Copy of the formal reciprocal exchange agreement between the sponsoring U.S. organization(s) and the organization(s) in a foreign country which will receive the United States artist or entertainer
Statement from the sponsoring organization describing the reciprocal exchange of United States artists or entertainers as it relates to the specific petition for which classification is sought
Evidence that you and the U.S. artist or entertainer subject to the reciprocal exchange agreement are artists with comparable skills and that the terms and conditions of employment are similar
Evidence that an appropriate labor organization in the United States was involved in negotiating, or has concurred with, the reciprocal exchange of U.S. and foreign artists or entertainers.

Note: If the events or performances will take place in multiple areas, an itinerary must be submitted. The itinerary must list the dates and locations of the events.

Once the visa petition is approved, you can apply at a U.S. embassy or consulate. For more information on visa application processing and issuance fees, see the ""Department of State's, travel.state.gov"" page.

Form I-129 is used to apply for a change of status, extension of stay or change of employment.

For more information see the ""Extend Your Stay” and “Change my Status” pages.

You may change employers, but only after your new employer has filed a new Form I-129 with USCIS requesting permission to employ you and extend your stay. You may not commence employment with the new employer until the Form I-129 has been approved.

Your spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 may obtain P-4 status. Your dependents may not engage in employment, but may attend school or college.

Essential support personnel who are an integral part of the performance of a P-2 artist or entertainer and who perform support services that cannot be readily performed by a U.S. worker, are eligible for P-2 classification. Support personnel may include stagehands, trainers, or those persons having critical knowledge of the specific services to be performed.

The U.S. employer must file a separate Form I-129 for support personnel. The petition must include the following documents:

Consultation from an appropriate labor organization
Statement describing the support person’s prior and current essentially, critical skills and experience with the P-2 artist or entertainer

Copy of a written contract between the employer and the support person or a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which the support person will be employed.
"
P-1B A Member of an Internationally Recognized Entertainment Group,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/p-1b-a-member-of-an-internationally-recognized-entertainment-group,"
The P-1B classification applies to you if you are coming to the United States temporarily to perform as a member of an entertainment group that has been established for a minimum of one year and recognized internationally as outstanding in the discipline for a sustained and substantial period of time.
For more information, see Volume 2, Part N of the USCIS Policy Manual.
At least 75 percent of the members of your group must have had a substantial and sustained relationship with the group for at least one year.
Your entertainment group must be internationally recognized, having a high level of achievement in a field evidenced by a degree of skill and recognition substantially above that ordinarily encountered, to the extent that such achievement is renowned, leading, or well-known in more than one country. The reputation of the group, not the individual achievements of its members or the acclaim of a particular production, is essential.
Note: Individual entertainers not performing as part of a group are not eligible for this visa classification.
Special Provisions for Certain Entertainment Groups
Noncitizen circus performers and essential circus personnel are exempt the one year requirement and the internationally recognized requirement. The noncitizen or noncitizens must be coming to join a nationally recognized circus.
Certain nationally known entertainment groups may have the internationally recognized requirement waived if they can establish they have been recognized nationally as outstanding in its discipline for a sustained amount of time in consideration of special circumstances.
Your U.S. employer, United States sponsoring organization, United States agent, or foreign employer through a United States agent must submit:
Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker accompanied by the appropriate fee and supporting documentation.
	Please note that the if petitioner will be filing as an agent for multiple employers, they must establish that they are duly authorized to act as an agent for all of your employers. The conditions can be found in the memorandum, Requirements for Agents and Sponsors Filing as Petitioners for the O and P Visa Classifications (PDF, 790.07 KB).

Written consultation from an appropriate labor organization
Itinerary with the dates and locations of the performances
A copy of the contract between the petitioner and the beneficiary or summary of terms of the oral agreement under which the beneficiary will be employed

	Your group has performed and will perform as a starring or leading entertainment group in production or events which have a distinguished reputation as evidenced by critical reviews, advertisements, publicity releases, publications, contracts, or endorsements

Change of Employer
If you are a professional P-1 athlete who is traded from one organization to another organization, your employment authorization will automatically continue for a period of 30 days after acquisition by the new organization, within which time the new organization must file a new Form I-129 for P-1 nonimmigrant classification. If your new employer, agent, or sponsor files a new Form I-129 within 30 days, you will remain in valid P-1 status, and your employment continues to be authorized, until the petition is adjudicated. If your new employer, agent, or sponsor does not file a new Form I-129 or the new petition is denied, employment authorization will cease.
In all other situations, you may change employers, but the new employer, your agent, or your sponsor must first file a new Form I-129 with USCIS requesting permission to employ you and extend your stay. You may not start working for the new employer until USCIS has approved the new Form I-129.

O Nonimmigrant Classifications: Question and Answers,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/o-1-individuals-with-extraordinary-ability-or-achievement/o-nonimmigrant-classifications-question-and-answers,"
Q: When can a U.S. agent file as a petitioner for an O beneficiary?
A: The regulations allow agents to be petitioners in the following scenarios:
A U.S. agent can file for traditionally self-employed workers, or workers who use agents to arrange short-term employment with numerous employers
A foreign employer who authorizes an agent to act on his/her behalf

A U. S. agent may be:
The actual employer of the beneficiary
The representative of both the employer and the beneficiary
A person or entity authorized by the employer(s) to act in place of the employer(s) as its agent 

Q: What evidence is required with a petition filed by a U.S. agent?
A: A petition filed by an agent is subject to additional evidentiary requirements listed under 8 CFR 214.2(o)(2)(iv)(E). The evidence required depends on whether the agent is filing as an agent performing the function of an employer; as a person or company in business as an agent and filing for multiple employers; or as an agent for a foreign employer.
Q:  How does an agent establish to USCIS that it is an agent performing the function of an employer?
A: When an agent performing the function of an employer petitions for the beneficiary, the petition must include the contractual agreement between the agent and the beneficiary which specifies the wage offered and other terms and conditions of employment. This can be a summary of the terms of the oral agreement or a written contract.
USCIS relies on the contractual agreement that must be provided with the petition to determine whether the agent is functioning as the employer of the beneficiary. The contractual agreement should establish the type of working relationship between the agent and beneficiary and should lay out how the beneficiary will be paid. In totality, if the terms and conditions of employment show a level of control over the beneficiary’s work being relinquished to the agent, then the agent may establish that it is performing the function of an employer. This determination will be on a case by case basis and will be based on the contractual agreement, whether written or oral. 
Q: What evidence is required to satisfy the “wage offered” requirement when an U.S. agent files as an agent performing the function of an employer?
A: The petition must be submitted with evidence regarding the wage offered.  However, the regulations do not contain a prevailing wage requirement.  Furthermore, no particular wage structure is required.  A detailed description of the wage offered or fee structure and that the wage offered/ fee structure was agreed upon may satisfy this requirement.
Q: When an agent performing the function of an employer files a petition, are contracts required with the employers where the beneficiary will be employed?
A. No, in the case of an O petition filed by an agent performing the function of an employer, a contract is not required between the beneficiary and the entities that will ultimately use the beneficiary’s services.
Q: What is the itinerary requirement for agents performing the function of an employer? 
A:  A petition that requires the noncitizen to work in more than one location must include an itinerary with the dates and locations of work. There are no exceptions to the itinerary requirement when the petition is filed by an agent performing the function of an employer. However, USCIS does give some flexibility to how detailed the itinerary must be and does take into account industry standards when determining whether the itinerary requirement has been met. As such, the itinerary should at a minimum indicate what type of work the beneficiary will be engaged, where, and when this work will take place.
Q: When an U.S. agent represents the beneficiary and multiple employers, are contracts required with the employers where the beneficiary will be employed?
A: Yes, a contract between the employer and the beneficiary is required to be submitted with an O petition filed by an agent. The contract between the beneficiary and the importing employer provides USCIS with evidence that an actual position exists and the O worker is coming to the United States to fill that position. An O worker cannot ""self-petition."" 
USCIS will accept either a written or an oral contract. The contract must demonstrate what was offered by the employer and what was accepted by the employee. If an oral contract was entered into, the document evidencing the oral contract does not have to be signed by both parties to establish that there is an oral agreement. However, it must document the terms of the employment offered and that the beneficiary has agreed to the offer. Such evidence may include but is not limited to:
Emails between the contractual parties
A written summation of the terms of the agreement
Any other evidence which demonstrates that an oral agreement was created

The regulations require that when the agent represents the beneficiary and employer(s), the petition must be accompanied by a complete itinerary of the events or activities. The itinerary must specify the dates of each service or engagement, the names and addresses of the actual employers and the names and addresses of the establishments, venues, or locations where the services will be performed.
Q: Can the U. S. agent be the actual employer of the beneficiary?
A: Yes, a U.S. agent can be the actual employer. When an agent petitions for the beneficiary as the employer the petition must include the contractual agreement between the agent and the beneficiary which specifies the wage offered and other terms and conditions of employment. This can be a summary of the terms of the oral agreement or a written contract.
Q: Can a U.S. agent who is the employer/petitioner for the beneficiary, also serve as an agent for other (multiple) employers?
A: Yes, a U.S. agent may be the actual employer and may file a petition on behalf of the beneficiary as his or her agent and on behalf of other employers of the beneficiary. In this scenario, the agent is required by regulations to provide:
The contract between the petitioner (agent) and the beneficiary
A complete itinerary that lists specific dates of each service or engagement
The names and addresses of the establishments, venues, or locations where the services will be performed
Contracts between the beneficiary and the employer(s)

The contracts that must be provided to USCIS can either be a summary of the oral agreement or a copy of the written contract. In addition, the petitioner must provide evidence establishing that the petitioner is authorized to act as an agent for the other employers. This may be satisfied with a document signed by the beneficiary’s other employer(s), which states the agent is authorized to act as their agent for the limited purpose of filing the petition. If the petitioner does not establish that the petitioner is authorized to act as an agent for the other employers, the petition may only be approved for the petitioner’s event.
Q. Can additional performances or engagements be added to a petition?
A. Yes, a petitioner may add additional performances or engagements for an O-1 artist or entertainer during the validity period of the petition without filing an amended petition.
In cases where there have been any material changes in the terms and conditions of the employment or the beneficiary’s eligibility, as specified in the original I-129, an amended I-129 petition must be filed.
Q. Can partially or fully self-incorporated persons petition for themselves in the O classification?
A. The regulations require that an O petition be filed by a U.S. employer, a U.S. agent, or a foreign employer through a U.S. agent. The regulations also state that O-1 noncitizens may not petition for themselves. The Immigration and Nationality Act requires that an O petition be filed by an importing employer. Documentation of ownership and control of the business may be requested in this circumstance to verify that the petitioning entity is a bona fide employer in the United States, that the petition is not based on speculative employment, and that the terms and conditions of actual employment qualify for O classification.
Q. Can a foreign employer be a corporation owned by the beneficiary?
A. Yes, but the petition must be filed by a U.S. agent. A foreign employer may be a corporation owned wholly or in part by the beneficiary, but the foreign employer must utilize a U.S. agent to file the petition.  A U.S. agent petitioning on behalf of a foreign employer must be authorized to file the petition, and to accept services of process in the United States in proceedings under section 274A of the Act, on behalf of the foreign employer. The petition cannot be based on speculative employment and the terms and condition of the actual employment must qualify for O classification. USCIS may request information regarding the foreign employer and documentation to establish that there is work in place for the beneficiary in the United States. 
A foreign employer who, through a U.S. agent, files a petition for an O nonimmigrant noncitizen is responsible for complying with all of the employer sanctions provisions of section 274A of the Act and 8 CFR part 274a.
O-1 Visa Home
"
O-1 Visa: Individuals with Extraordinary Ability or Achievement,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/o-1-visa-individuals-with-extraordinary-ability-or-achievement,"
The O-1 nonimmigrant visa is for the individual who possesses extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, or who has a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement in the motion picture or television industry and has been recognized nationally or internationally for those achievements.
For more information, see USCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M.
The O nonimmigrant classification are commonly referred to as:
O-1A: Individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics (not including the arts, motion pictures or television industry);
O-1B: Individuals with an extraordinary ability in the arts or extraordinary achievement in motion picture or television industry;
O-2: Individuals who will accompany an O-1 artist or athlete to assist in a specific event or performance; and
O-3: Individuals who are the spouse or children of O-1 and O-2 visa holders.

To qualify for an O-1 visa, you must demonstrate extraordinary ability by sustained national or international acclaim, or a record of extraordinary achievement in the motion picture and television industry, and must be coming temporarily to the United States to continue work in the area of extraordinary ability.
Extraordinary ability in the fields of science, education, business or athletics means a level of expertise indicating that you are one of the small percentage who have arisen to the very top of the field. For detailed information regarding how USCIS evaluates evidence to determine O-1A eligibility, including examples and considerations that are especially relevant for those in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, see the USCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M, Chapter 4, Section C, and Appendix: Satisfying the O-1A Evidentiary Requirements.
Extraordinary ability in the field of arts means distinction. Distinction means a high level of achievement in the field of the arts. This is evidenced by a degree of skill and recognition substantially above that ordinarily encountered, to the extent that you are prominent, renowned, leading, or well-known in the field of arts. For detailed information on how USCIS evaluates evidence to determine O-1B eligibility, including examples and considerations, see USCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M, Chapter D and Appendix: Satisfying the O-1B Evidentiary Requirements.
To qualify for an O-1 visa in the motion picture or television industry, you must demonstrate extraordinary achievement. This is evidenced by a degree of skill and recognition significantly above that ordinarily encountered, to the extent that you are recognized as outstanding, notable or leading in the motion picture and/or television field. For detailed information on how USCIS evaluates evidence to determine O-1B eligibility, including examples and considerations, see USCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M, Chapter E and Appendix: Satisfying the O-1B Evidentiary Requirements.
To qualify for an O-2 visa, your assistance must be an “integral part” of the O-1A visa holder’s performance and you must have critical skills and experience with the O-1 visa holder that are not of a general nature and cannot be readily performed by a U.S. worker. In the case of an O-2 visa holder in the motion picture or television industry, you must have skills and experience with the O-1 visa holder that are not of a general nature and which are critical either based on a pre-existing longstanding working relationship or, with respect to the specific production, because significant production (including pre- and post-production work) will take place both inside and outside the United States and your continuing participation is essential to the successful completion of the production.
A U.S. employer, U.S. agent, or foreign employer through a U.S. agent should file (see Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker) on your behalf, along with the required evidence according to the form instructions. Your employer or agent cannot file the petition more than one year before they actually need your services. To avoid delays, your employer or agent should file your Form I-129 at least 45 days before the date of employment.
In addition to Form I-129, the petitioner must submit the documentary evidence discussed below:
Consultation
The Petitioner must provide a written advisory opinion from a peer group (including labor organizations) or a person with expertise in the beneficiary’s area of ability. If the O-1 petition is for an individual with extraordinary achievement in motion picture or television, the consultation must come from an appropriate labor union and a management organization with expertise in the beneficiary’s area of ability.
When a consultation includes a watermark or other distinctive marks to confirm the authenticity of the document, petitioners should submit to USCIS the version containing the watermark or other distinctive marks. Copies of documents that do not contain the appropriate watermark or other distinctive marks may raise doubts about the authenticity of the document and may result in processing delays. For example, USCIS may request that the petitioner submit the original version of the document. To avoid processing delays, petitioners should ensure that they submit the appropriate version and that any associated watermark or other distinctive marks are legible.
Exceptions to the Consultation Requirement
If your employer or agent can demonstrate that an appropriate peer group, including a labor organization, does not exist, then we will base our decision on the evidence they submit in support of the Form I-129. We may waive a consultation if you have extraordinary ability in the field of arts and you are seeking readmission to perform similar services within two years of the date of a previous consultation. Your employer or agent should submit a waiver request and a copy of the previous consultation with the petition.
For more information on consultations for O nonimmigrants, see USCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M, Chapter 7.
Contract between petitioner and beneficiary
The Petitioner must submit a copy of any written contract between you and the petitioner or a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which you will be employed.
For additional information about the contract requirement for O-1 nonimmigrants, and considerations specific to agent petitioners, see USCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M, Chapter 7.
Itineraries
The petitioner must provide an explanation of the nature of the events or activities, the beginning and ending dates for the events or activities, and a copy of any itinerary for the events or activities, if applicable. The petitioner must establish that there are events or activities in your field of extraordinary ability for the validity period requested such as an itinerary for a tour or a series of events.
Agents
A U.S. agent may be your actual employer, the representative of both you and the employer, or a person or entity authorized by the employer to act for, or in place of, the employer as its agent. Detailed information regarding USCIS policy relating to agent petitioners can be found in the USCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M, Chapter 3.
Evidence demonstrating O-1 Eligibility
The petitioner must provide evidence demonstrating your extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, business, education, or athletics, or extraordinary achievement in the motion picture industry. The record must include at least three different types of documentation corresponding to those listed in the regulations, or comparable evidence in certain circumstances, and the evidence must, as a whole, demonstrate that you meet the relevant standards for classification. Detailed information regarding how USCIS evaluates evidence to determine eligibility and whether you are coming to the United States to continue working in the area of extraordinary ability can be found in the USCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M, Chapter 4.
Your employer or agent should file Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, on your behalf, along with the required evidence according to the form instructions. They must petition for you in connection with the services of an O-1 artist or athlete, but you and the O-1 artist or athlete must each have your own Form I-129. Your employer or agent cannot file your Form I-129 more than one year before the artist or athlete will begin employment. To avoid delays, your employer or agent should file your Form I-129 at least 45 days before the date of employment.
In addition to Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker, the petitioner must submit the following documentary evidence:
Consultation
If you will support of an individual with extraordinary ability in athletics or the arts, the consultation must be from the appropriate labor organization; or
If you will support of an individual with extraordinary achievement in motion pictures or television, the consultation must come from an appropriate labor organization and a management organization with expertise in the skill area involved.
Evidence Demonstrating O-2 Eligibility
The evidence should establish your current essentiality, critical skills, and experience with the O-1 beneficiary and that you have substantial experience performing the critical skills and essential support services for the O-1.
In the case of a specific motion picture or television production, the evidence should establish that significant production, including pre- and post-production, has taken place outside the United States and will take place inside the United States, and that you’re your continuing participation is essential to the successful completion of the production.
After We Approve Your Petition
Once we approve your petition, you can apply for your visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Department of State (DOS) establishes visa application processing and issuance fees. For more information, see DOS’s Temporary Workers Visas Department of State page.
As an O nonimmigrant, you may be admitted to the United States for the validity period of the petition, plus a period of up to 10 days before the validity period begins and 10 days after the validity period ends. You are only authorized to work during the validity period of the petition.
For detailed information regarding validity periods, see USCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M, Chapter 9.
If you need to extend your stay to continue or complete the same event or activity, your employer or agent must file the following documents with USCIS:
Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker;
A copy of your Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record; and
A statement explaining the reasons for the extension.

To help us process your request, the statement should describe the event or activity that was the basis for the original approval and confirm that the extension is needed so you can continue or complete the same event or activity as described.
Your spouse and children must file Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change
Nonimmigrant Status, and submit any supporting documents to extend their stay.
For more information see our Form I-539 page.
If your spouse and children under the age of 21 will accompanying you or join you later (called “following to join”), they may be eligible to apply for an O-3 nonimmigrant visa, that will be subject to the same period of admission and limitations as you. They may not work in the United States under this classification, but they may participate in full-time or part-time study on an O-3 visa.
If you are an O-1 nonimmigrant in the United States and want to change employers, the new employer must file Form I-129 with the USCIS office listed on the form instructions. If an agent filed your original petition, your new employer must file an amended petition with evidence showing they are your new employer and a request for an extension of stay.
If there has been any material change, those other than the addition of additional performances or engagements that require someone of extraordinary ability, in the terms and conditions of your employment or eligibility, your employer or agent must file an amended Form I-129 with the service center where the original petition was filed.
Athletes
There are special rules for O-1 professional athletes. If you are traded from one team to another, employment authorization will continue with the new team for 30 days, during which time the new employer must file a new Form I-129. Filing the new Form I-129 within this 30-day period extends your employment authorization at least until we process your petition. If the new employer does not file a new Form I-129 within 30 days of the trade, you lose your employment authorization. You also lose your employment authorization if we deny your new Form I-129.
If your employer terminates your employment for reasons other than your voluntary resignation, they must pay for the reasonable cost of return transportation to your last place of residence before entering the United States. If an agent filed the petition for the employer, the agent and the employer are equally responsible for paying these costs.

"Frequently Asked Questions about Part 6 of Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker",https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/frequently-asked-questions-about-part-6-of-form-i-129-petition-for-a-nonimmigrant-worker,"
On Nov. 23, 2010, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) revised Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker. The revised Form I-129 and subsequent editions contain Part 6, Certification Regarding the Release of Controlled Technology or Technical Data to Foreign Persons in the United States. Part 6 must be completed for certain Form I-129 petitions postmarked on or after Feb. 20, 2011.
Q1. What is Part 6 of Form I-129?A1. Part 6 of Form I-129 is an attestation regarding the release of controlled technology or technical data to foreign persons in the United States. Part 6 requires petitioners to affirm that they have reviewed the export control regulations. It further requests petitioners to indicate whether a license is required from either the Department of Commerce (DOC) or the Department of State (DOS) to release technology or technical data to the beneficiary of the petition. If a license is required, the petitioner must certify that the beneficiary will not access such technology or data until the license has been obtained.
Q2. What is the purpose of Part 6?A2. In 2002, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that vulnerabilities in the deemed export licensing system could allow technology transfers to countries of concern (GAO-02-972). The GAO reported that DOC was not sufficiently coordinating its efforts with those of INS (now USCIS) to identify and follow up on noncitizens who change their immigration status to obtain jobs that could involve dual-use technology controlled under the Export Administration Act.
In addition, an April 2004 report (OIG-04-23) issued by the Inspectors General of several departments -- including DOS, DOC and Homeland Security found that USCIS did not include the protection of controlled technology as part of its process of adjudicating change-of-status applications submitted by noncitizens in the United States.
Part 6 of Form I-129 was a solution for addressing the issues raised in these two reports.
Q3. What are the export control requirements?A3. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) require U.S. persons, including companies, to seek and receive authorization from the U.S. government before releasing controlled technology or technical data to foreign persons in the United States (15 CFR Parts 770-774 and 22 CFR Parts 120-130). U.S. companies must seek and receive a license from DOC and/or DOS before releasing controlled technology or technical data to nonimmigrant workers.
Q4. Are these export control regulations new?A4. No. These export control regulations are not new. However, Form I-129 was revised on Nov. 23, 2010, to include Part 6, Certification Regarding the Release of Controlled Technology or Technical Data to Foreign Persons in the United States. Part 6 must be completed for certain Form I-129 petitions postmarked on or after Feb. 20, 2011.
Q5. Is Part 6 required for all Form I-129 petitions?A5. No. Part 6 must be completed only for petitions seeking H-1B, H-1B1, L-1, or O-1A nonimmigrant status for the beneficiary.
Q6. Will a petition be rejected if Part 6 is required but has not been completed after Feb. 20, 2011?A6. No. USCIS will not reject Form I-129 if Part 6 is not completed. USCIS will issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) to provide the petitioner with the opportunity to complete Part 6.
Q7. What will happen to a petition if Part 6 is required but the petitioner declines to respond to the RFE?A7. The petition will be denied should the petitioner decline to respond to Part 6 in response to an RFE.
Q8. Will USCIS require a copy of the export control license if one is necessary?
A8. No. At this time, USCIS does not require a copy of the export control license as part of the nonimmigrant visa petition process.
Q9. Will a petition be denied if an export control license is required but has not been obtained prior to filing the petition?A9. No. USCIS will not deny the petition on the basis that a license is required but has not been obtained prior to the filing of the petition. However, the certification on Form I-129 includes a statement that the petitioner will prevent access to the controlled technology or technical data until and unless the petitioner has received the required license or other authorization to release it to the beneficiary. Failure to do so, where required under applicable law, may constitute a basis for revocation of the Form I-129 petition.
Q10. Where can I obtain additional information about the export control regulations?A10. DOC’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) administers the Commerce Control List (CCL) and is responsible for issuing licenses under the EAR. Information about EAR and how to apply for a license from BIS can be found at www.bis.doc.gov. Specific information about EAR’s requirements pertaining to the release of controlled technology can be found at www.bis.doc.gov/deemedexports.
DOS’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) administers the U.S. Munitions List (USML) and is responsible for issuing licenses under the ITAR. Information about the ITAR and how to apply for a license from DDTC can be found at www.pmddtc.state.gov. Specific information about the ITAR’s requirements pertaining to the release of controlled technical data can be found on the DDTC's Getting and Staying in Compliance with the ITAR page."
L-1B Intracompany Transferee Specialized Knowledge,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/l-1b-intracompany-transferee-specialized-knowledge,"
The L-1B nonimmigrant classification enables a U.S. employer to transfer a professional employee with specialized knowledge relating to the organization’s interests from one of its affiliated foreign offices to one of its offices in the United States. This classification also enables a foreign company that does not yet have an affiliated U.S. office to send a specialized knowledge employee to the United States to help establish one. The employer must file Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker with fee, on behalf of the employee.
To qualify for L-1 classification in this category, the employer must:
Have a qualifying relationship with a foreign company (parent company, branch, subsidiary, or affiliate, collectively referred to as qualifying organizations); and
Currently be, or will be, doing business as an employer in the United States and in at least one other country directly or through a qualifying organization for the duration of the beneficiary’s stay in the United States as an L-1. While the business must be viable, there is no requirement that it be engaged in international trade.

Doing business means the regular, systematic, and continuous provision of goods and/or services by a qualifying organization and does not include the mere presence of an agent or office of the qualifying organization in the United States and abroad.
To qualify, the named employee must also:
Generally have been working for a qualifying organization abroad for one continuous year within the three years immediately preceding his or her admission to the United States; and
Be seeking to enter the United States to provide services in a specialized knowledge capacity to a branch of the same employer or one of its qualifying organizations.

Specialized knowledge means either special knowledge possessed by an individual of the petitioning organization’s product, service, research, equipment, techniques, management, or other interests and its application in international markets, or an advanced level of knowledge or expertise in the organization’s processes and procedures (See 8 CFR 214.2(l)(1)(ii)(D)).
The L-1 Visa Reform Act of 2004 applies to all petitions filed on or after June 6, 2005, and is directed particularly to those filed on behalf of L-1B employees who will be stationed primarily at the worksite of an of an employer other than the petitioning employer or its affiliate, subsidiary, or parent. In order for the employee to qualify for L-1B classification in this situation, the petitioning employer must show that:
The employee will not be principally controlled or supervised by such an unaffiliated employer; and
The work being provided by the employee is not considered to be labor for hire by such an unaffiliated employer.

See INA 214(c)(2)(F) and Chapter 32.3(c) of the USCIS Adjudicator’s Field Manual, available in the ""Laws"" section of the website.
For foreign employers seeking to send an employee with specialized knowledge to the United States to be employed in a qualifying new office, the employer must show that:
The employer has secured sufficient physical premises to house the new office ; and
The employer has the financial ability to compensate the employee and begin doing business in the United States.

See 8 CFR 214.2(l)(3)(vi) for details.
Qualified employees entering the United States to establish a new office will be allowed a maximum initial stay of one year. All other qualified employees will be allowed a maximum initial stay of three years. For all L-1B employees, requests for extension of stay may be granted in increments of up to an additional two years, until the employee has reached the maximum limit of five years.
Family of L-1 Workers
The transferring employee may be accompanied or followed by their spouse and unmarried children who are under 21 years of age. Spouses and children may seek admission in the L-2 nonimmigrant classification and, if approved, generally will be granted the same period of stay as the employee.
If these family members are already in the United States and seeking change of status to or extension of stay in the L-2 classification, they may apply collectively, with fee, using Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Status.
Spouses of L-1 workers in valid L-2S nonimmigrant status are considered employment authorized incident to status. DHS-issued evidence of such employment authorization that is acceptable for completion of Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, include:
Certain L nonimmigrant spouses qualify for the automatic extension of their existing Form I-766 EADs if they meet the following conditions:
They timely filed a renewal Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, based on the same L nonimmigrant status; and
They have an unexpired Form I-94 showing their status as an L-2 or L-2S nonimmigrant.

Normally, DHS regulations provide for an automatic extension period of up to 180 days from the expiration date stated on the EAD. However, DHS has published a temporary final rule increasing the automatic extension period. Effective May 4, 2022, DHS is temporarily increasing the automatic extension period and providing up to 360 days of additional automatic extension time, for a total of up to 540 days, to eligible renewal applicants. The automatic EAD extension will therefore continue until whichever comes first:
The end date on the dependent spouse’s Form I-94 showing valid L-2 or L-2S nonimmigrant status, as applicable;
The date we approve or deny their application to renew the previous EAD; or
540 days from the “Card Expires” date on the front of the previous EAD.

Additional information on the temporary increase of the automatic extension period is available on the Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension page.
Eligible L spouses may present the following evidence of the automatic EAD extension to employers for Form I-9 purposes:
Form I-94 indicating the unexpired L-2 or L-2S nonimmigrant status;
Form I-797C for a timely-filed EAD renewal application (Form I-765) stating “Class requested” as “(a)(18)”; and
The expired EAD issued under the same category, Category A18.

Form I-129 Pilot Program for Canadian L-1 Nonimmigrants
From April 30, 2018, to April 30, 2020, the California Service Center and the CBP Blaine, Washington, port of entry (POE) are participating in a joint agency pilot program for Canadian citizens seeking L-1 nonimmigrant status under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). For additional information, please visit the Form I-129/I-129S Pilot Program for Canadian L-1 Nonimmigrants.
Blanket Petitions
Certain organizations may establish the required intracompany relationship in advance of filing individual L-1 petitions by filing a blanket petition. Eligibility for blanket L certification may be established if:
The petitioner and each of the qualifying organizations are engaged in commercial trade or services;
The petitioner has an office in the United States which has been doing business for one year or more;
The petitioner has three or more domestic and foreign branches, subsidiaries, and affiliates; and
The petitioner along with the other qualifying organizations, collectively, meet one of the following criteria:
	Have obtained at least 10 L-1 approvals during the previous 12-month period;
Have U.S. subsidiaries or affiliates with combined annual sales of at least $25 million; or
Have a U.S. work force of at least 1,000 employees.


Have obtained at least 10 L-1 approvals during the previous 12-month period;
Have U.S. subsidiaries or affiliates with combined annual sales of at least $25 million; or
Have a U.S. work force of at least 1,000 employees.

The approval of a blanket L petition does not guarantee that an employee will be granted L-1B classification. It does, however, provide the employer with the flexibility to transfer eligible employees to the United States without having to file an individual petition with USCIS. In order to qualify under the blanket petitioning process, the employee having specialized knowledge must also be a professional. See 8 CFR 214.2(l)(1)(ii)(E).
Where an L-1 visa is required
In most cases, once the blanket petition has been approved, the employer need only complete a Form I-129S, Nonimmigrant Petition Based on Blanket L Petition, and send it to the employee along with a copy of the blanket petition Approval Notice and other required evidence, so that the employee may present it to a U.S. consular officer in connection with an application for an L-1 visa.
Canadians with an approved blanket petition seeking L-1 classification 
Canadian citizens, who are exempt from the L-1 visa requirement, may present the completed Form I-129S and supporting documentation to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer at certain POEs on the United States-Canada land border or at a United States pre-clearance/pre-flight inspection station in Canada, in connection with an application for admission to the United States in L-1 status.
Please refer to CBP’s website for additional information and/or requirements for applying for admission into the United States.
Optional filing of Form I-129S with USCIS 
If the prospective L-1 employee is visa-exempt, the employer may file the Form I-129S and supporting documentation with the USCIS Service Center that approved the blanket petition, instead of submitting the form and supporting documentation directly with CBP.
See 8 CFR 214.2(l)(4) and 8 CFR 214.2(l)(5) for more details regarding blanket petitions.

Filing Multiple L-1 Intracompany Transferee Petitions Related to the Same Project,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/l-1b-intracompany-transferee-specialized-knowledge/filing-multiple-l-1-intracompany-transferee-petitions-related-to-the-same-project,"
USCIS recognizes that businesses may need to temporarily move multiple employees to the United States for particular projects which require the employees’ specialized knowledge. In order to do this, employers may petition for their employees to obtain an L-1 nonimmigrant classification by filing Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker. While each L-1 petition must be considered on its own merits, USCIS will consider multiple applications grouped into “bundles” of L-1 petitions in order to streamline and improve the adjudication process. 
 In order for USCIS to consider the bundle, all included L-1B petitions must be related to employees:
On the same project
Who will work at the same location and
Who have substantially the same specialized knowledge duties

 USCIS will also consider petitions for L-1A managers included with the bundle, if they will be managing the L-1B beneficiaries who will be working on the project.
Complete a separate Form I-129 for each employee.
Include petitions in the bundle:
	From the same petitioner
On behalf of beneficiaries employed at the same foreign entity who will be seeking initial L-1 status or an extension of L-1 status, and who will be working on the same project at the same location performing substantially the same specialized knowledge duties
Filed under the same service (that is,either requesting all premium processing or non-premium processing);
Of L-1A managers if they will be managing the L-1B beneficiaries who will be working on the project.

Package each petition separately with its own fees and supporting evidence.
Indicate the multiple related filings by, for example, including a cover sheet with information the petitioner believes may be useful to assist USCIS in processing the related filings as a bundle.
If using a cover sheet, write, “L-1 Bundle” in large, bold print at the top of the cover sheet. Petitioners should list their name and the project’s name and location, and number each cover sheet included in the bundle (e.g., 1 of 10 petitions, 2 of 10 petitions, etc.). 
If USCIS is unable to determine whether a petition contained in the bundle is related to the same petitioner, project, location, or substantially the same specialized knowledge duties, USCIS will process the petition as if it were received individually.

From the same petitioner
On behalf of beneficiaries employed at the same foreign entity who will be seeking initial L-1 status or an extension of L-1 status, and who will be working on the same project at the same location performing substantially the same specialized knowledge duties

Filed under the same service (that is,either requesting all premium processing or non-premium processing);
Of L-1A managers if they will be managing the L-1B beneficiaries who will be working on the project.

Petitioners can submit more than one bundle of L-1 petitions if there is more than one specialized knowledge occupation substantially related to a project. If petitioners are filing more than one bundle of petitions for beneficiaries who will be performing substantially different specialized knowledge duties for the same project, they should number each bundle (e.g., 1 of 3 bundles, 2 of 3 bundles, etc.) for ease of processing.
Petitioners are reminded that they must include all required evidence (as well as Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, if applicable, and Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service) with each petition within the bundle. While petitions may be submitted as a bundle, each petition must be individually supported by the required evidence.
"
L-1A Intracompany Transferee Executive or Manager,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/l-1a-intracompany-transferee-executive-or-manager,"
The L-1A nonimmigrant classification enables a U.S. employer to transfer an executive or manager from one of its affiliated foreign offices to one of its offices in the United States. This classification also enables a foreign company that does not yet have an affiliated U.S. office to send an executive or manager to the United States with the purpose of establishing one. The employer must file a Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, with fee, on behalf of the employee.
The following information describes some of the features and requirements of the L-1 nonimmigrant visa program.
General Qualifications of the Employer and Employee
To qualify for L-1 classification in this category, the employer must:
Have a qualifying relationship with a foreign company (parent company, branch, subsidiary, or affiliate, collectively referred to as qualifying organizations); and
Currently be, or will be, doing business as an employer in the United States and in at least one other country directly or through a qualifying organization for the duration of the beneficiary’s stay in the United States as an L-1. While the business must be viable, there is no requirement that it be engaged in international trade.

Doing business means the regular, systematic, and continuous provision of goods and/or services by a qualifying organization and does not include the mere presence of an agent or office of the qualifying organization in the United States and abroad.
To qualify, the named employee must also:
Generally have been working for a qualifying organization abroad for one continuous year within the three years immediately preceding his or her admission to the United States; and
Be seeking to enter the United States to provide service in an executive or managerial capacity for a branch of the same employer or one of its qualifying organizations.

Executive capacity generally refers to the employee’s ability to make decisions of wide latitude without much oversight.
Managerial capacity generally refers to the ability of the employee to supervise and control the work of professional employees and to manage the organization, or a department, subdivision, function, or component of the organization. It may also refer to the employee’s ability to manage an essential function of the organization at a high level, without direct supervision of others. See section 101(a)(44) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, and 8 CFR 214.2(l)(1)(ii) for complete definitions.
New Offices
For foreign employers seeking to send an employee to the United States as an executive or manager to establish a new office, the employer must also show that:
The employer has secured sufficient physical premises to house the new office;
The employee has been employed as an executive or manager for one continuous year in the three years preceding the filing of the petition; and
The intended U.S. office will support an executive or managerial position within one year of the approval of the petition.

See 8 CFR 214.2(l)(3)(v) for details.
Period of Stay
Qualified employees entering the United States to establish a new office will be allowed a maximum initial stay of one year. All other qualified employees will be allowed a maximum initial stay of three years. For all L-1A employees, requests for extension of stay may be granted in increments of up to an additional two years, until the employee has reached the maximum limit of seven years.
Family of L-1 Workers
The transferring employee may be accompanied or followed by their spouse and unmarried children who are under 21 years of age. Spouses and children may seek admission in the L-2 nonimmigrant classification and, if approved, generally will be granted the same period of stay as the employee.
If these family members are already in the United States and seeking changes of status to or extension of stay in L-2 classification, they may apply collectively, with fee, on an Form I-539, Application to Change/Extend Nonimmigrant Status.
Spouses of L-1 workers in valid L-2S nonimmigrant status are considered employment authorized incident to status. DHS-issued evidence of such employment authorization that is acceptable for completion of Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, include:
Certain L spouses qualify for the automatic extension of their existing Form I-766 EADs if they meet the following conditions:
They timely filed a renewal Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, based on the same L nonimmigrant status; and
They have an unexpired Form I-94 showing their status as an L-2 or L-2S nonimmigrant.

Normally, DHS regulations provide for an automatic extension period of up to 180 days from the expiration date stated on the EAD. However, DHS has published a temporary final rule increasing the automatic extension period. Effective May 4, 2022, DHS is temporarily increasing the automatic extension period and providing up to 360 days of additional automatic extension time, for a total of up to 540 days, to eligible renewal applicants. The automatic EAD extension will therefore continue until whichever comes first:
The end date on the dependent spouse’s Form I-94 showing valid L-2 or L-2S nonimmigrant status, as applicable;
The date we approve or deny their application to renew the previous EAD; or
540 days from the “Card Expires” date on the front of the previous EAD.

Additional information on the temporary increase of the automatic extension period is available on the Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension page.
Eligible L spouses may present the following evidence of the automatic EAD extension to employers for Form I-9 purposes:
Form I-94 indicating the unexpired L-2 or L-2S nonimmigrant status;
Form I-797C for a timely-filed EAD renewal application (Form I-765) stating “Class requested” as “(a)(18)”; and
The expired EAD issued under the same category, Category A18.

Form I-129 Pilot Program for Canadian L-1 Nonimmigrants
From April 30, 2018, to April 30, 2020, the California Service Center and the CBP Blaine, Washington, port of entry (POE) are participating in a joint agency pilot program for Canadian citizens seeking L-1 nonimmigrant status under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Blanket Petitions
Certain organizations may establish the required intracompany relationship in advance of filing individual L-1 petitions by filing a blanket petition. Eligibility for blanket L certification may be established if:
The petitioner and each of the qualifying organizations are engaged in commercial trade or services;
The petitioner has an office in the United States that has been doing business for one year or more;
The petitioner has three or more domestic and foreign branches, subsidiaries, and affiliates; and
The petitioner along with the other qualifying organizations meet one of the following criteria:
	Have obtained at least 10 L-1 approvals during the previous 12-month period;
Have U.S. subsidiaries or affiliates with combined annual sales of at least $25 million; or
Have a U.S. work force of at least 1,000 employees.

Have U.S. subsidiaries or affiliates with combined annual sales of at least $25 million; or
Have a U.S. work force of at least 1,000 employees.

The approval of a blanket L petition does not guarantee that an employee will be granted L-1A classification. It does, however, provide the employer with the flexibility to transfer eligible employees to the United States quickly and with short notice without having to file an individual petition with USCIS.
Where an L-1 visa is required
In most cases, once the blanket petition has been approved, the employer need only complete Form, I-129S,Nonimmigrant Petition Based on Blanket L Petition, and send it to the employee along with a copy of the blanket petition Approval Notice and other required evidence, so that the employee may present it to a consular officer in connection with an application for an L-1 visa.
Canadians with an approved blanket petition seeking L-1 classification
Canadian citizens, who are exempt from the L-1 visa requirement, may present the completed Form I-129S and supporting documentation to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer at certain ports-of-entry on the United States-Canada land border or at a United States pre-clearance/pre-flight inspection station in Canada, in connection with an application for admission to the United States in L-1 status.
Please refer to CBP’s website for additional information and/or requirements for applying for admission into the United States.
Optional filing of Form I-129S with USCIS
If the prospective L-1 employee is visa-exempt, the employer may file the Form I-129S and supporting documentation with the USCIS service center that approved the blanket petition, instead of submitting the form and supporting documentation directly with CBP.
See 8 CFR 214.2(l)(4) and 8 CFR 214.2(l)(5) for more details regarding blanket petitions.

VIBE Program
Work Authorization
"
I Representatives of Foreign Media,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/i-representatives-of-foreign-media,"
You may be eligible for the I, Representatives of Foreign Media, nonimmigrant visa, if you:
Represent a foreign information media outlet (press, radio, film, or other foreign information media);
Are coming to the United States to engage solely in this profession; and
Have a home office in a foreign country.

Occupations under this category include reporters, film crews, editors, and similar occupations. Any spouse and children under the age of 21 may accompany or follow to join an I nonimmigrant.
Eligibility Criteria
You must demonstrate that you are a bona fide representative of foreign media whose activities are essential to the functions of your organization. The consular officer at the U.S. embassy will determine whether an activity is qualifying in order to obtain a nonimmigrant visa.
Application Process
You can apply for an I visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate with jurisdiction over your place of permanent residence. The Department of State establishes visa application processing and issuance fees. For detailed application instructions, see the Department of State’s website.
As a representative of foreign media, you cannot travel to the U.S. and engage in your profession without an I nonimmigrant visa, even if you are a citizen of a country that participates in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program (VWP). If you attempt to travel to the U.S. without the appropriate visa, you may be denied admission by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at the port of entry (airport, seaport, or land border). There are limited instances under which you, as a foreign media representative, may be eligible to travel with a visitor’s visa. See the Department of State’s website for more information.
Period of Stay
At the port of entry, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer will determine if you can be admitted to the United States. The officer will review and stamp Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, which will contain your authorized period of stay. Admission as an I nonimmigrant is generally authorized for the duration of status (i.e., D/S on Form I-94), and no application for extension of stay is required to be filed as long as the media representative continues working for the same employer in the same information medium. If Form I-94 indicates a specific end date for your authorized period of stay, and you wish to stay beyond that specified end date, you must file a Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, in accordance with the form filing instructions, and submit any required evidence and applicable fees.
Alert: On May 11, 2020, DHS’ U.S. Customs and Border Protection published a final rule limiting the maximum period of stay for I nonimmigrants from the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Under this rule, eligible I nonimmigrants from the PRC (with the exception of I nonimmigrants holding Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and Macau SAR passports) may be admitted or granted I nonimmigrant status only for the period necessary to accomplish the authorized purpose of their stay in the United States, not to exceed 90 days.
If you are an I nonimmigrant in this category wishing to stay in the United States to continue your I activities beyond the date specified on your Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, you must request an extension of stay by filing Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, for a period necessary to complete your I activities, not to exceed 90 days. You may submit multiple, sequential, timely-filed extension of stay requests, for extensions of up to 90 days if you can demonstrate activities or assignments consistent with the I classification for the requested period(s). You may remain in the United States while your timely-filed extension of stay application is pending. If you depart the United States while your extension of stay application is pending, USCIS may deny your request.
In terms of employment while your timely-filed extension of stay application is pending, you may continue your I employment with the same employer and in the same medium for 90 days (or the period of time you requested if it is less than 90 days) from the date your Form I-94 expired. As a general guideline, you must stop working if more than 90 days have passed since your Form I-94 has expired and your timely-filed extension of stay application remains pending. You may resume employment if the pending application is approved, but only for the length of time remaining from that application. At any time after the expiration of your Form I-94, the denial of an extension of stay application requires you to cease work activities and depart the United States immediately.
Requesting Change of Status to I Nonimmigrant or Change of Employer or Information Medium
If you are currently in the United States and wish to request a change of status from another nonimmigrant classification to an I nonimmigrant status, or if you currently hold I status and wish to request a change of employer or information medium, you must file Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, in accordance with the form filing instructions and with the proper fees. Your application should be accompanied by evidence of your current status and a letter from the employing foreign media organization describing the employment and establishing the fact that you are a representative of that media organization.
Family of I Visa Holders
Any accompanying or following-to-join spouse and children under the age of 21 may be eligible to apply for an I nonimmigrant visa. If your spouse and/or children apply for visas at a later date, they must submit a copy of your I nonimmigrant visa with their application. Your spouse and children are not eligible to work with an I nonimmigrant visa, but can study in the United States without applying for an F-1 nonimmigrant student visa. If your spouse and children only intend to visit for vacation and do not intend to reside with you in the United States, they may travel to the United States with a B-2 nonimmigrant visa, or travel without a nonimmigrant visa if they qualify under the U.S. Visa Waiver Program (VWP). For additional information about the VWP, see the Department of State’s website."
H-3 Nonimmigrant Trainee or Special Education Exchange Visitor,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-3-nonimmigrant-trainee-or-special-education-exchange-visitor,"
The H-3 nonimmigrant visa category allows noncitizens coming temporarily to the United States as either a:

Trainee to receive training in any field of endeavor, other than graduate medical education or training, that is not available in the noncitizen’s home country.
Special Education Exchange Visitor to participate in a special education exchange visitor training program that provides for practical training and experience in the education of children with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities.

For more information, see USCIS Policy Manual Volume 2: Nonimmigrants, Part J, Trainees (H-3) [2 USCIS-PM J]

An H-3 “trainee” must be invited by an individual or organization for the purpose of receiving training, in any field including but not limited to:  

Agriculture
Commerce 
Communications 
Finance 
Government 
Transportation 
Other Professions

This classification is not intended for U.S. employment.  It is designed to provide a noncitizen with job-related training for work that will ultimately be performed outside the United States.

In order to obtain H-3 classification, a U.S. employer or organization must demonstrate that:

The proposed training is not available in the noncitizen’s native country;
The noncitizen will not be placed in a position which is in the normal operation of the business and in which U.S. citizens and resident workers are regularly employed;
The noncitizen will not engage in productive employment unless such employment is incidental and necessary to the training; and
The training will benefit the beneficiary in pursuing a career outside the United States.

 Each H-3 petition for a trainee must include a statement that:

Describes the type of training and supervision to be given, and the structure of the training program;
Sets the proportion of time that will be devoted to productive employment;
Shows the number of hours that will be spent, respectively, in classroom instruction and in on –the-job training;
Describes the career abroad for which the training will prepare the noncitizen;
Indicates the reasons why such training cannot be obtained in the noncitizen’s country and why it is necessary for the noncitizen to be trained in the United States; and
Indicates the source of any remuneration received by the trainee and any benefit which will accrue to the employer/organization for providing the training.

A training program may not be approved which:

Deals in generalities with no fixed schedule, objectives or means of evaluation;
Is incompatible with the nature of the petitioner’s business or enterprise;
Is on behalf of a noncitizen who already possess substantial training and expertise in the proposed field of training;
Is in a field in which it is unlikely that the knowledge or skill will be used outside the United States;
Will result in productive employment beyond that which is incidental and necessary to the training;
Is designed to recruit and train noncitizens for the ultimate staffing of domestic operations in the United States;
Does not establish that the petitioner has the physical plant and sufficiently trained manpower to provide the training specified; or
Is designed to extend the total allowable period of practical training previously authorized a nonimmigrant student.

There is a numerical limit (or “cap”) on the number of H-3 special education exchange visitors. No more than 50 may be approved in a fiscal year. 

A petition requesting an H-3 “special education exchange visitor” must be filed by a facility which has professionally trained staff and a structured program for providing education to children with disabilities, and for providing training and hands-on experience to participants in the special education exchange visitor program.   It should include a description of:

The training the noncitizen will receive;
The facility’s professional staff; and
The noncitizen’s participation in the training program.

In addition, the petition must show that the special education exchange visitor is:

Nearing the completion of a baccalaureate or higher degree program in special education; or
Has already earned a baccalaureate or higher degree in special education;  or
Has extensive prior training and experience teaching children with physical, mental or emotional disabilities.

Note: Any custodial care of children must be incidental to the noncitizen’s training.

In order to obtain H-3 classification, the U.S. employer or organization must file a Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker. The petition must be filed with the information provided above.

If the petition is approved, the trainee may be allowed to remain in the United States for up to 2 years. If the trainee petition is approved for a special education exchange visitor, the trainee may remain in the United States for up to 18 months.

Trainees' spouses and children who are under the age of 21 may accompany them to the United States as H-4 nonimmigrants. However, H-4 nonimmigrants are not permitted to work in the United States.
"
H-2B Temporary Non-Agricultural Workers,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2b-temporary-non-agricultural-workers,"
REMINDER: Starting April 13, 2023, we will begin accepting petitions for workers for the late second half of FY 2023, requesting employment start dates from May 15, 2023, to Sept. 30, 2023. The 10,000 visas made available under this allocation are limited to returning workers who were issued H-2B visas or held H-2B status in fiscal years 2020, 2021, or 2022, regardless of country of nationality.
Petitions requesting supplemental allocations under this rule must be filed at the California Service Center. Petitions filed under the supplemental allocations in this rule at any location other than the California Service Center will be rejected and the filing fees will be returned.
USCIS is continuing to accept H-2B petitions under the allocation of 20,000 visas set aside for nationals of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Haiti.
ALERT: As of Jan. 30, 2023, USCIS has received enough petitions to reach the additional 18,216 H-2B visas made available for returning workers for the first half of FY 2023 with start dates on or before March 31, 2023, under the FY 2023 H-2B supplemental visa temporary final rule.
We will reject and return any cap-subject petitions received after Jan. 30, 2023, for H-2B returning workers with start dates on or before March 31, 2023, together with any accompanying fees. Read more:  Cap Reached for Additional Returning Worker H-2B Visas for the First Half of FY 2023.
ALERT: The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor are issuing a temporary final rule that makes available 64,716 additional H-2B temporary nonagricultural worker visas for fiscal year (FY) 2023. These supplemental H-2B visas are for U.S. employers seeking to petition for additional workers at certain periods of the fiscal year before Sept. 15, 2023. This is the first time the Departments have issued a single rule making available H-2B supplemental visas for several allocations throughout the entire fiscal year, including an allocation for the late second half. More information is available on the Temporary Increase in H-2B Nonimmigrant Visas for FY 2023 page.
The H-2B program allows U.S. employers or U.S. agents who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary nonagricultural jobs. A U.S. employer, or U.S. employer, or U.S. agent as described in the regulations, must file Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, on a prospective worker’s behalf.
Who May Qualify for H-2B Classification?
To qualify for H-2B nonimmigrant classification, the petitioner must establish that:
There are not enough U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to do the temporary work.
Employing H-2B workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.
Its need for the prospective worker’s services or labor is temporary, regardless of whether the underlying job can be described as temporary. The employer’s need is considered temporary if it is a(n):
	One-time occurrence – A petitioner claiming a one-time occurrence must show that it has:
		An employment situation that is otherwise permanent, but a temporary event of short duration has created the need for a temporary worker.
Not employed workers to perform the service or labor in the past, and will not need workers to perform the services or labor in the future;



One-time occurrence – A petitioner claiming a one-time occurrence must show that it has:
		An employment situation that is otherwise permanent, but a temporary event of short duration has created the need for a temporary worker.
Not employed workers to perform the service or labor in the past, and will not need workers to perform the services or labor in the future;


An employment situation that is otherwise permanent, but a temporary event of short duration has created the need for a temporary worker.
Not employed workers to perform the service or labor in the past, and will not need workers to perform the services or labor in the future;

OR 
Seasonal need – A petitioner claiming a seasonal need must show that the service or labor for which it seeks workers is:

	Traditionally tied to a season of the year by an event or pattern; and
Of a recurring nature.


Traditionally tied to a season of the year by an event or pattern; and
Of a recurring nature.

Note: You cannot claim a seasonal need if the time period when you do NOT need the service or labor is: 
Unpredictable; 
Subject to change; or 
Considered a vacation period for your permanent employees.

OR
Peak load need – A petitioner claiming a peak load need must show that it:

	Regularly employs permanent workers to perform the services or labor at the place of employment;
Needs to temporarily supplement its permanent staff at the place of employment due to a seasonal or short-term demand; and
The temporary additions to staff will not become part of the employer's regular operation.


Regularly employs permanent workers to perform the services or labor at the place of employment;
Needs to temporarily supplement its permanent staff at the place of employment due to a seasonal or short-term demand; and
The temporary additions to staff will not become part of the employer's regular operation.

OR
Intermittent need – A petitioner claiming an intermittent need must show that it:

	Has not employed permanent or full-time workers to perform the services or labor; and
Occasionally or intermittently needs temporary workers to perform services or labor for short periods.


Has not employed permanent or full-time workers to perform the services or labor; and
Occasionally or intermittently needs temporary workers to perform services or labor for short periods.

H-2B petitioners must also provide a single valid temporary labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), or, if the workers will be employed on Guam, from the Guam Department of Labor (Guam DOL).
H-2B Cap
There is a statutory numerical limit, or ""cap,"" on the total number of noncitizens who may be issued an H-2B visa or otherwise granted H-2B status during a fiscal year. Currently, Congress has set the H-2B cap at 66,000 per fiscal year, with 33,000 for workers who begin employment in the first half of the fiscal year (October 1 - March 31) and 33,000 for workers who begin employment in the second half of the fiscal year (April 1 - September 30). Any unused numbers from the first half of the fiscal year will be available for employers seeking to hire H-2B workers during the second half of the fiscal year. However, unused H-2B numbers from one fiscal year do not carry over into the next.
Once the H-2B cap is reached, USCIS may only accept petitions for H-2B workers who are exempt from the H-2B cap.  For additional information on the current H-2B cap, and on workers who are exempt from it, see the Cap Count for H-2B Nonimmigrants Web page.
H-2B Program Process
Step 1: Petitioner submits temporary labor certification application to DOL. Before requesting H-2B classification from USCIS, the petitioner must apply for and receive a temporary labor certification for H-2B workers with the U.S. Department of Labor (or Guam DOL if the employment will be in Guam).* For further information regarding the temporary labor certification application requirements and process, see the Foreign Labor Certification, Department of Labor and Foreign Labor Certification, Guam Department of Labor Web pages.
Step 2: Petitioner submits Form I-129 to USCIS. After receiving a temporary labor certification for H-2B employment from either DOL or Guam DOL (if applicable), the petitioner must file Form I-129 with USCIS. With limited exceptions, the petitioner must submit the original temporary labor certification with Form I-129 (See the Form I-129 instructions for additional filing requirements). If the application for a temporary labor certification was processed in DOL’s FLAG system, the petitioner must include a printed copy of the electronic one-page “final determination” of the H-2B temporary labor certification approval with Form I-129. USCIS will consider a printed copy of the final determination as the original and approved temporary labor certification. If a petitioner has already submitted the original temporary labor certification with a previous Form I-129, submit a copy of the temporary labor certification and provide an explanation that includes the receipt number of the petition with which the original was filed, if available.
Step 3: Prospective workers outside the United States apply for visa and/or admission. After USCIS approved Form I-129, prospective H-2B workers who are outside the United States must:
	Apply for an H-2B visa with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and then seek admission to the United States with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at a U.S. port of entry; or
Directly seek admission to the United States in H-2B classification with CBP at a U.S. port of entry in cases where an H-2B visa is not required.


Apply for an H-2B visa with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and then seek admission to the United States with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at a U.S. port of entry; or
Directly seek admission to the United States in H-2B classification with CBP at a U.S. port of entry in cases where an H-2B visa is not required.

*Note: If you are petitioning for one or more Canadian musicians that will be employed within a 50 mile radius from the U.S.-Canadian border for 30 days or less, you may skip Step 1 in the H-2B process.
Reporting H-2B Fraud
Anyone (including American workers and H-2B workers who suspect they or others may be the victim of H-2B fraud or abuse) can send us tips, alleged violations, and other relevant information about potential fraud or abuse using our online tip form.
H-2B Eligible Countries List
Except as noted below, H-2B petitions may only be approved for nationals of countries that the secretary of homeland security has designated, with the concurrence of the Office of the Secretary of State, as eligible to participate in the H-2B program.
The Department of Homeland Security publishes the list of H-2A and H-2B eligible countries in a Federal Register notice. Designation of eligible countries is valid for one year from publication.
Effective Nov. 10, 2022, nationals from the following countries are eligible to participate in the H-2B program:
*Regarding all references to “country” or “countries” in this document, it should be noted that the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-8, Section 4(b)(1), provides that “[w]henever the laws of the United States refer or relate to foreign countries, nations, states, governments, or similar entities, such terms shall include and such laws shall apply with respect to Taiwan.” 22 U.S.C. § 3303(b)(1). Accordingly, all references to “country” or “countries” in the regulations governing whether nationals of a country are eligible for H-2 program participation, 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(i)(F)(1)(i) and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(E)(1), are read to include Taiwan. This is consistent with the United States’ one-China policy, under which the United States has maintained unofficial relations with Taiwan since 1979.
A national from a country not on the list may only be the beneficiary of an approved H-2B petition if the secretary of homeland security determines that it is in the U.S. interest for the national to be the beneficiary of such a petition. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(iii) and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(E)(2) for additional evidentiary requirements.
The secretary of homeland security may consider adding a country to the Eligible Countries List upon receiving a recommendation from the U.S. Department of State or a written request from an unlisted foreign government, an employer that would like to hire nationals of an unlisted country in H-2A status, or another interested party or parties. When designating countries to include on the list, the secretary of Homeland Security, with the concurrence of the Office of the Secretary of State, will take into account factors that include the following:
The country’s cooperation with issuing travel documents for the citizens, subjects, nationals and residents of that country who are subject to a final order of removal
The number of final and unexecuted (meaning completed but not yet carried out) orders of removal against citizens, subjects, nationals and residents of that country
The number of orders of removal issued and executed against citizens, subjects, nationals and residents of that country
Other factors that may serve the U.S. interest. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(i)(F)(1)(i) and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(E)(1).

If you want DHS to consider adding a country to the Eligible Countries List, send a written request to DHS’s Office of Policy or the Department of State at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Country listings are valid for one year. DHS may add a country to the Eligible Countries List at any time if the secretary of homeland security determines that the country is eligible.
Note: If you request H-2B workers from both eligible and non-eligible countries, USCIS suggests that you file two separate petitions. Filing one petition for workers from eligible countries and a separate petition for workers from non-eligible countries may help decrease delays in processing your request for H-2B workers
Period of Stay
Generally, USCIS may grant H-2B classification for up to the period of time authorized on the temporary labor certification. H-2B classification may be extended for qualifying employment in increments of up to 1 year each. A new, valid temporary labor certification covering the requested time must accompany each extension request. The maximum period of stay in H-2B classification is 3 years.
A person who has held H-2B nonimmigrant status for a total of 3 years must depart and remain outside the United States for an uninterrupted period of 3 months before seeking readmission as an H-2B nonimmigrant. Additionally, previous time spent in other H or L classifications counts toward total H-2B time.
Exception: Certain periods of time spent outside of the United States may ""interrupt"" an H-2B worker's authorized stay and not count toward the 3-year limit. See the Calculating Interrupted Stay for H-2 Classifications Web page for additional information.
Family of H-2B Workers
Any H-2B worker's spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age may seek admission in H-4 nonimmigrant classification. Family members are not eligible for employment in the United States while in H-4 status.
Employment-Related Notifications to USCIS
OMB Control Number 1615-0107
Petitioners of H-2B workers must notify USCIS within 2 workdays if any of the following occur:
No show: The H-2B worker fails to report to work within 5 work days of the latter of:

	The employment start date on the H-2B petition; or
The start date established by the employer;

Abscondment: The H-2B worker leaves without notice and fails to report for work for a period of 5 consecutive workdays without the consent of the employer;
Termination: The H-2B worker is terminated before completing the H-2B labor or services for which he or she was hired; or
Early Completion: The H-2B worker finishes the labor or services for which he or she was hired more than 30 days earlier than the date specified in the H-2B petition.

The employment start date on the H-2B petition; or
The start date established by the employer;

Petitioners must include the following information in the employment-related notification:
Name
Address
Phone number
Employer identification number (EIN)

Name
Address
Phone number

Full Name
Date of birth
Place of birth
Last known physical address and phone number

Additionally, to help USCIS identify the H-2B worker, submit the following for each H-2B worker, if available:
Social Security number, and
Visa number

Note: USCIS defers to DOL’s definition of “workday.” According to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), this generally means the period of time on any particular day when an employee begins and ends his or her “principal activities.”

H-2B Petitions Exempt from the Temporary Need Requirement
The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (FY 2018 NDAA) created an exemption for certain H-2B petitioners on Guam and in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) from the requirement to show that the need for a worker is temporary.  This exemption has been extended and amended by subsequent NDAAs. Volume 2, Part I, Chapter 11 of the USCIS Policy Manual provides additional information and guidance on qualifying for the exemption.

Guidance on “Temporary Need” in H-2B Petitions,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2b-non-agricultural-workers/guidance-on-temporary-need-in-h-2b-petitions,"
H-2B petitioners must show that their need for workers fits the definition of a “temporary need” under immigration law. USCIS has not changed its longstanding policy interpreting “temporary need” under 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(ii).  This page provides guidance to help petitioners comply with existing regulatory requirements when filing H-2B petitions and reflects the guidance that USCIS officers must follow when adjudicating H-2B petitions.
For information about H-2B petitions that are exempt from the temporary need requirement, see Volume 2, Part I, Chapter 11 of the USCIS Policy Manual.
Note: The term “DOL” on this page refers to both U.S. Department of Labor and Guam Department of Labor, unless otherwise specified.
The Definition of “Temporary Need”
USCIS defines “temporary need” for H-2B petitions according to 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(ii). To determine whether the H-2B petitioner has a temporary need, USCIS analyzes:
What duties the workers will perform, as specified in the petition;
Whether the employer needs the number of temporary workers requested to perform those duties; and
Whether the need extends throughout the employment period requested.

Four Bases for Establishing Temporary Need
Petitioners must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that their temporary need is based on one of the following: a one-time occurrence, a seasonal need, a peakload need, or an intermittent need.
One-time occurrence: The law requires a petitioner to show one of the following to establish a temporary need based on a “one-time occurrence”:

	The petitioner has not employed workers to perform the services or labor in the past, and the petitioner will not need workers to perform this in the future; or
The petitioner has an employment situation that is otherwise permanent, but a temporary event of short duration has created a need for temporary workers. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B)(1).

Seasonal need: The law defines a “seasonal need” as a need that is “traditionally tied to a season of the year by an event or pattern and is of a recurring nature. The petitioner shall specify the period(s) of time during each year in which it does not need the services or labor. The employment is not seasonal if the period during which the services or labor is not needed is unpredictable or subject to change or is considered a vacation period for the petitioner's permanent employees.” See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B)(2).

The petitioner has not employed workers to perform the services or labor in the past, and the petitioner will not need workers to perform this in the future; or
The petitioner has an employment situation that is otherwise permanent, but a temporary event of short duration has created a need for temporary workers. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B)(1).

A seasonal need may not necessarily be limited to the traditional four seasons (winter, spring, summer, and fall). Seasonal could include legal “seasons” (such as fishing seasons) and “events” tied to a season (such as the Christmas shopping season) as described by the definition.
Peakload need: To establish a peakload need, the law requires a petitioner to “establish that it regularly employs permanent workers to perform the services or labor at the place of employment and that it needs to supplement its permanent staff at the place of employment on a temporary basis due to a seasonal or short-term demand and that the temporary additions to staff will not become a part of the petitioner’s regular operation.” (Emphasis added.) See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B)(3).

It is clear from the regulation that a peakload need must be of a limited duration. That does not mean that a peakload need may not recur on a periodic basis.
Intermittent need: A petitioner claiming an intermittent need must establish that “it has not employed permanent or full-time workers to perform the service or labor, but occasionally or intermittently needs temporary workers to perform services or labor for short periods.” See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B)(4).

An example of an intermittent need might be a company that produces limited edition porcelain ware to commemorate a special event, but only from time to time and not on a fixed schedule. By definition, it is highly unlikely that a petition covering consecutive periods of time would meet this definition.
The Difference Between a Seasonal and Peakload Need
Although the definition of peakload need uses the phrase “seasonal or short-term demand,” there are significant differences between these two types of temporary needs. Unlike in the case of a seasonal need, a petitioner claiming a peakload need must demonstrate the existence of a permanent workforce. Moreover, a peakload need may recur at different times of the year and/or multiple times in the same year. On the other hand, a seasonal need might be based around a sports season that extends for the same six months, year after year. A peakload need would typically last for a shorter amount of time and may recur several months later during the same year (for example, during the Memorial Day weekend and again during Labor Day weekend). Depending on the facts of a specific case, a peakload need may also recur at the same time year after year. Generally, extension petitions covering consecutive periods of time without a significant break do not establish either peakload or seasonal need.
In some cases, peakload needs may be unpredictable in nature. In contrast, our regulations state that seasonal needs may not be unpredictable or subject to change.
Temporary Need Must End in the Near, Definable Future
Petitioners are responsible for demonstrating that the employer needs H-2B workers only for a limited period of time, meaning that the need will end in the near, definable future. Generally, this means that the maximum period of need must be one year or less. The precise period of need depends on the specific facts presented, and USCIS may not grant an H-2B validity period exceeding the validity period on the TLC. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(9)(iii)(B).
However, in the case of a one-time occurrence, a temporary need could last up to 3 years. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B). Depending on the facts, we may approve consecutive petitions to cover a continuous period of up to a total of three years.
Temporary Labor Certification (TLC)
By regulation, all H-2B petitions must be submitted with an approved TLC. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(iii)(C) and (vi)(A). USCIS regulations state that an approved TLC is advisory in nature. Nevertheless, an approved TLC may support a finding that the employer has a temporary need. In all cases, USCIS has the ultimate authority to determine whether a petition satisfies the requirements of section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(iii)(A). It is therefore our responsibility to ensure that the need is actually temporary according to current law and policy.
At the time DOL adjudicates a TLC application, it may not have the same information that we have at the time that we examine the Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker. If an adjudicator determines that initial evidence, including an approved TLC, does not support a finding of temporary need according to the law, the adjudicator may request that the petitioner provide additional evidence to establish the employer’s temporary need.
Approving a Different Type of Temporary Need than the Need Listed on the TLC
USCIS may approve an H-2B petition as long as the petitioner has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the need for workers is a one-time occurrence, a seasonal need, peakload need, or intermittent need. Because the approved TLC is advisory, we may approve the petition even if we determine the type of temporary need the petitioner has is different than the need certified by DOL on the approved TLC. For example, if the TLC was approved based on a peakload need rather than a seasonal need, we may still approve the H-2B petition for a seasonal need if the evidence establishes that the employer’s need meets the definition of a seasonal need.
Detailed Statement of Need
Petitioners must submit a detailed statement describing their temporary need. If this statement contains sufficient details about the employer’s operations and need for the workers to perform temporary services or labor during a finite period of time, it may be sufficient to establish temporary need, depending on all the facts presented in the case. In some cases, however, the regulations specifically require a petitioner to provide initial evidence in addition to the detailed statement of need. For example, if the approved TLC requires certain education, training, experience, or special requirements, a petitioner must also submit additional documentation with the petition to demonstrate that the beneficiary meets those requirements. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(vi)(C). We will also consider other documentation provided in support of the employer’s temporary need as supplementary evidence when deciding whether a statement is sufficiently detailed.
In all cases, it is the quality and probative value of the information provided in the statement that will be determinative, not merely the quantity of that information. For instance, if the statement contains inconsistencies or is inconsistent with other evidence in the case, we may need to issue a Request for Evidence to determine whether the employer’s need is in fact temporary in nature. The adjudicator is the finder of fact, and it is within the adjudicator’s discretion to determine whether the statement presented is sufficiently detailed to conclude that the petitioner has met its burden of establishing temporary need.
Any petitioner who submits a skeletal petition will not meet the burden of proof.
Adjudicating Case by Case
With the limited exception of certain H-2B positions on Guam and in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) as discussed in Volume 2, Part I, Chapter 11 of the USCIS Policy Manual, USCIS evaluates all H-2B petitions for whether the employer has a temporary need, and it is the petitioner’s burden in all cases to establish a temporary need. Our adjudicators look at the totality of the evidence in each case when adjudicating H-2B petitions. Therefore, no single fact alone will determine whether an employer’s need is temporary.
As we evaluate all the evidence in a case, we may determine certain facts indicate that the employer’s need is not temporary. However, the mere fact that a petitioner has previously sought workers for the same or a similar position does not, by itself, mean that we will find that there is no temporary need.
Factors That USCIS Considers When Determining Temporary Need
Evaluating Petitions
Because seasonal, peakload and intermittent needs typically recur, USCIS must ensure that an employer’s needs are, in fact, temporary in nature. Therefore, if a petitioner files a subsequent petition that extends beyond the current maximum period that DOL may issue on a single TLC, we look at the totality of the facts and may question the subsequently filed petition.
Except for cases involving a one-time occurrence, we will evaluate whether the employer has a temporary need and possibly deny a petition if:
Determining If a Petitioner’s Need is Temporary
Below is a non-exhaustive list of inquiries and examples of supplementary evidence that USCIS may consider, in addition to the required detailed statement, to determine whether a petitioner’s need is temporary. Adjudicators will base their request for additional evidence on the specific facts of each case.
Examples of relevant factors include:
Does the employer employ a permanent staff or workforce that also performs the same duties?

Supplementary evidence may include but is not limited to:
Payroll records distinguishing the H-2B workforce from the permanent workers in the requested occupation;
Staffing/workload data showing a breakdown of temporary vs. permanent staff, data by month;
Data on the employer’s annual historical need for workers; and/or
Copies of the employer’s agreements or contracts with permanent employees.
Are there periods of time when H-2B workers are not needed to perform the same job duties? If so, for how long?

USCIS may use this factor to determine whether an employer’s need for the duties is temporary and is particularly relevant for the finding of seasonal need. However, an H-2B petitioner claiming a peakload need must demonstrate that:
The employer has a permanent staff,
Temporary workers supplement the permanent staff during certain times of the year, and
Temporary workers are not part of the employer’s regular operation.

Temporary need may not be based on a need to provide coverage for an employer’s vacationing permanent employees. While a statement of need can be sufficiently detailed, submitting payroll records as supplementary evidence may assist USCIS in determining whether there is a temporary need.
Did the same employer file more than one Form I-129 petition for workers to perform the same job duties in one year?

If a petitioner filed more than one Form I-129 petition either concurrently or consecutively, USCIS may look at these factors to decide whether the employer actually has a permanent, year-round need for the job duties. These factors include:
Do two or more Form I-129 petitions reflect different job duties to be performed?

This can be determined by the occupational codes for the workers, or by examining the tools used and individual tasks performed by the workers. If the job duties being performed are the same, USCIS may inquire about whether the total period of time reflected on two or more approved TLCs supporting the Form I-129 petitions reflects a permanent, year-round need.
Does the petitioner operate separate and distinct business entities?

USCIS may consider, among others, whether there are separate owners or separately incorporated entities. Supplementary evidence may include separate articles of incorporation, tax documents (W-2, federal tax receipts, employer ID numbers), bank accounts, or certificates of worker’s compensation.
Do the separate petitions cover separate seasons?

Supplementary evidence may include, among others, work contracts, invoices, client documents, or employees’ work schedules, and similar documents showing:
The work reoccurs on the same cycle each year, or
The work will be performed in certain months each year, and/or
Gaps each year when services are not needed.
Does the petitioner employ different beneficiaries for each distinct period of need?

Different beneficiaries required for the work on separate petitions may indicate that the employer’s needs are for distinct duties. Supplementary evidence may include payroll records, staffing/workload data, or employment contracts showing that the petitioner has different workers. In the case of a peakload need, the regulations require that “the temporary additions to staff will not become a part of the petitioner’s regular operation.” See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B)(3).
 
What is the petitioner’s filing history?

Adjudicators will use internal system databases to examine petitioners’ relationships with other petitioners and their filing history. A petitioner’s filing history may also indicate whether the petitioner has a year-round, permanent need for workers. Depending on the evidence in our internal system databases, adjudicators may issue a Request for Evidence in certain circumstances when they have an articulable basis for questioning whether the employer in fact has a temporary need for H-2B beneficiaries.
Note: No single factor or combination of factors weighs more heavily than any other factor. USCIS determines each case on its own merits based on all of the facts presented, using the preponderance of the evidence standard."
H-2A Temporary Agricultural Workers,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2a-temporary-agricultural-workers,"
The H-2A program allows U.S. employers or U.S. agents who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary agricultural jobs. A U.S. employer, a U.S. agent as described in the regulations, or an association of U.S. agricultural producers named as a joint employer must file Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, on a prospective worker’s behalf.
Who May Qualify for H-2A Classification?
To qualify for H-2A nonimmigrant classification, the petitioner must:
Offer a job that is of a temporary or seasonal nature.
Demonstrate that there are not enough U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to do the temporary work.
Show that employing H-2A workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.
Generally, submit a single valid temporary labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor with the H-2A petition. (A limited exception to this requirement exists in certain “emergent circumstances.”See e.g., 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(x) for specific details.)

H-2A Program Process
Step 1: Petitioner submits temporary labor certification application to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).  Before requesting H-2A classification from USCIS, the petitioner must apply for and receive a temporary labor certification for H-2A workers from DOL. For further information regarding the temporary labor certification requirements and process, see the Foreign Labor Certification, Department of Labor Web page.
Step 2: Petitioner submits Form I-129 to USCIS. After receiving a temporary labor certification for H-2A employment from DOL, the petitioner must file Form I-129 with USCIS. With limited exceptions, the petitioner must submit original temporary labor certification as initial evidence with Form I-129. (See the instructions to Form I-129 for additional filing requirements.)
Step 3: Prospective workers outside the United States apply for visa and/or admission. After USCIS approves Form I-129, prospective H-2A workers who are outside the United States must:
	Apply for an H-2A visa with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and then seek admission to the United States with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at a U.S. port of entry; or
Directly seek admission to the United States in H-2A classification with CBP at a U.S. port of entry, if a worker does not require a visa in cases where an H-2A visa is not required.


Apply for an H-2A visa with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and then seek admission to the United States with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at a U.S. port of entry; or
Directly seek admission to the United States in H-2A classification with CBP at a U.S. port of entry, if a worker does not require a visa in cases where an H-2A visa is not required.

H-2A Eligible Countries List
Except as noted below, H-2A petitions may only be approved for nationals of countries that the secretary of homeland security has designated, with the concurrence of the Office of the Secretary of State, as eligible to participate in the H-2A program.
The Department of Homeland Security publishes the list of H-2A and H-2B eligible countries in a Federal Register notice. Designation of eligible countries is valid for one year from publication.
Effective Nov. 10, 2022, nationals from the following countries are eligible to participate in the H-2A program:
*Regarding all references to “country” or “countries” in this document, it should be noted that the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-8, Section 4(b)(1), provides that “[w]henever the laws of the United States refer or relate to foreign countries, nations, states, governments, or similar entities, such terms shall include and such laws shall apply with respect to Taiwan.” See 22 U.S.C. § 3303(b)(1). Accordingly, all references to “country” or “countries” in the regulations governing whether nationals of a country are eligible for H-2 program participation. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(i)(F)(1)(i) and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(E)(1), are read to include Taiwan. This is consistent with the United States’ one-China policy, under which the United States has maintained unofficial relations with Taiwan since 1979.
The secretary of homeland security may consider adding a country to the Eligible Countries List upon receiving a recommendation from the U.S. Department of State or a written request from an unlisted foreign government, an employer that would like to hire nationals of an unlisted country in H-2A status, or another interested party or parties. When designating countries to include on the list, the secretary of homeland security, with the concurrence of the Office of the Secretary of State, will take into account factors that include the following:
The country’s cooperation with issuing travel documents for citizens, subjects, nationals and residents of that country who are subject to a final order of removal
The number of final and unexecuted (meaning completed but not yet carried out) orders of removal against citizens, subjects, nationals and residents of that country
The number of orders of removal executed against citizens, subjects, nationals and residents of that country
Other factors as may serve the U.S. interest. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(i)(F)(1)(i) and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(E)(1).

If you want DHS to consider adding a country to the Eligible Country List, send a written request to DHS’s Office of Policy, or the Department of State at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Country listings are valid for one year. DHS may add a country to the Eligible Country List whenever the secretary of homeland security determines that the country is eligible.
A national from a country not on the list may only be the beneficiary of an approved H-2A petition if the secretary of homeland security determines that it is in the U.S. interest for the national to be the beneficiary of such a petition. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(iii) and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(i)(F)(1)(ii) for additional evidentiary requirements.
Note: If you request H-2A workers from both eligible and non-eligible countries, USCIS suggests that you file two separate petitions. Filing one petition for workers from eligible countries and a separate petition for workers from non-eligible countries may help decrease delays in processing your request for H-2A workers.
Period of Stay
Generally, USCIS may grant H-2A classification for up to the period of time authorized on the temporary labor certification. H-2A classification may be extended for qualifying employment in increments of up to 1 year each. A new, valid temporary labor certification covering the requested time must accompany each extension request. The maximum period of stay in H-2A classification is 3 years.
A person who has held H-2A nonimmigrant status for a total of 3 years must depart and remain outside the United States for an uninterrupted period of 3 months before seeking readmission as an H-2A nonimmigrant. Additionally, previous time spent in other H or L classifications counts toward total H-2A time.
Exception: Certain periods of time spent outside of the United States may “interrupt” an H-2A worker’s authorized stay and not count toward the 3-year limit. See the Calculating Interrupted Stay for H-2 Classifications Web page for additional information.
Family of H-2A Workers
An H-2A worker’s spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age may seek admission in H-4 nonimmigrant classification. Family members are not eligible for employment in the United States while in H-4 status.
Employment-Related Notifications to USCIS
OMB Control Number 1615-0107
Petitioners of H-2A workers must notify USCIS within 2 workdays if any of the following occur:
No show: The H-2A worker fails to report to work within 5 work days of the latter of:

	The employment start date on the H-2A petition, or
The start date established by the employer;

Abscondment: The H-2A worker leaves without notice and fails to report for work for 5 consecutive workdays without the consent of the employer;
Termination: The H-2A worker is terminated before completing of the H-2A labor or services for which he or she was hired; or
Early Completion: The H-2A worker finishes the labor or services for which he or she was hired more than 30 days earlier than the date specified in the H-2A petition.

The employment start date on the H-2A petition, or
The start date established by the employer;

Petitioners must include the following information on the employment-related notification:
Name
Address
Phone number
Employer identification number (EIN)

Name
Address
Phone number

Full Name
Date of birth
Place of birth
Last known physical address and phone number

Additionally, to help USCIS identify the H-2A worker, submit the following for each H-2A worker, if available:
Social Security number
Visa number

Failure to Notify USCIS: A petitioner who fails to comply with these employment notification requirements, or fails to demonstrate good cause for untimely notification, may be required to pay $10 in liquidated damages for each instance of noncompliance.
Note: USCIS defers to DOL’s definition of “workday.” According to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), this generally means the period of time on any particular day when an employee begins and ends his or her “principal activities.”

Calculating Interrupted Stays for the H-2 Classifications
Reminder: Certain Fees May Not Be Collected From H-2A and H-2B Workers
"
Calculating Interrupted Stays for the H-2 Classifications,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2a-agricultural-workers/calculating-interrupted-stays-for-the-h-2-classifications,"
USCIS officers use the term “interrupted stay” when adjudicating extension of stay requests in the H-2A and H-2B nonimmigrant classifications. It refers to certain periods of time an H-2 worker spends outside the United States during an authorized period of stay, that do not count toward the noncitizen’s maximum 3-year limit in the classification. 
Interrupted stay regulations are the same for both H-2A and H-2B.  They are summarized as follows:
Time in H-2 status is not automatically interrupted if the H-2 worker departs the United States. It will be considered to be interrupted if the guidelines in the chart above are met. Additionally:
If H-2 time is interrupted, time stops accruing toward the H-2 worker’s 3-year limit.  Once they return to the United States in H-2 status, time toward the 3-year limit begins to accrue again from the point where it stopped.
If the H-2 worker has reached the 3-year limit, they must depart and remain outside the United States for at least 3 months before being readmitted in H-2 status.
Any time the H-2 worker is outside the United States for at least 3 months, their 3-year limit restarts from the beginning upon the worker’s readmission to the United States in H-2 status (for example, starts again at “day one”).

Important factors to consider include:
The definition of “day”:  For purposes of interrupted stays, a day is a full 24-hour period (from midnight to midnight) outside the United States. USCIS calculates a travel day to or from the United States as a full day in the United States – even if the H-2 worker departs at 12:01 a.m.
The definition of “month”:  For purposes of interrupted stays, a month can be anywhere from 28 to 31 days, depending on which month is used to calculate the interruption.
Distinguish between months and days:  The chart above tracks the regulations. If the chart states months, we calculate months – not an equivalent number of days.
Leap years:  When counting days, we always consider whether a particular year has February 29.
Effect of multiple interrupted stays:  An H-2 worker may acquire more than one interrupted stay during the same 3-year period. It is important to remember that the 3-year maximum period of stay is calculated from the worker’s first date of entry in H-2 status – not from their most recent date of entry in H-2 status (unless the worker was outside the United States for at least 3 months between entries).

We will calculate an interrupted stay only when you (the petitioner) request us to do so. Alternatively, your representative may make the request on your behalf if they have filed Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, with your Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker.
You (the petitioner) have the responsibility to show that an interrupted stay occurred. To show this, submit evidence with Form I-129 of all the beneficiary’s entries in, and departures from, the United States during the current 3-year period of stay. If the evidence you submit is insufficient, we may request additional evidence from you.
There is no piece of evidence that is “better” than others or “always acceptable.”  Evidence must clearly show a date of departure from, or arrival in, the United States. We consider each piece of evidence on a case-by-case basis.
The evidence you submit must show that it is “more likely than not” that the beneficiary arrived in or departed from the United States on the dates that you request. We may not grant an interrupted stay if we cannot verify your claims.
You are not required to file more than one petition per temporary labor certification. However, you may benefit from filing multiple petitions. Here are some examples of how you could benefit:
If we request additional evidence to verify interrupted stays for some H-2 workers, petition processing may be delayed. Filing a separate petition for H-2 workers for whom you are not requesting interrupted stays may enable you to obtain approval on behalf of those workers more quickly (if they are otherwise eligible) while processing continues for the other petition.
We may shorten the validity period for one or more of your H-2 workers if we are unable to verify your claims for some periods of interrupted stay. Doing this may cause the validity period for all other workers to be shortened, because petition validity periods are limited to the worker with the shortest approvable validity period. Filing a separate petition for workers for whom you are not requesting interrupted stays may allow them to get the full validity periods you request, if they are otherwise eligible.
We may shorten the validity period of one or more of your H-2 workers if they will reach the 3-year maximum period of stay during your requested validity period. Doing this may cause the validity period for all other workers to also be shortened. Filing a separate petition for workers who are not nearing the 3-year limit may allow them to get the full validity periods you request, if they are otherwise eligible.

If you do choose to file more than one petition with the same temporary labor certification, you may do so if:
You pay all relevant fees for each petition;
The total number of beneficiaries you request on the petitions you submit does not exceed the total number of workers approved by the Department of Labor on the temporary labor certification;
One petition is accompanied by the original temporary labor certification; and
The other petitions are accompanied by photocopies of the same labor certification and a statement explaining why the original was not submitted, such as:
	“I submitted the original temporary labor certification in connection with a previously filed petition. The receipt number for that petition is [insert number]”; or
“I am filing more than one H-2 petition at this time for some of the total of [Insert number of workers] workers covered by the original temporary labor certification.  I submitted (or am submitting) the original temporary labor certification with the other petition, covering the remaining number of workers authorized in the temporary labor certification.” 


“I submitted the original temporary labor certification in connection with a previously filed petition. The receipt number for that petition is [insert number]”; or
“I am filing more than one H-2 petition at this time for some of the total of [Insert number of workers] workers covered by the original temporary labor certification.  I submitted (or am submitting) the original temporary labor certification with the other petition, covering the remaining number of workers authorized in the temporary labor certification.”

Certain H-4 dependent spouses of H-1B nonimmigrants can file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, if the H-1B nonimmigrant:
Is the principal beneficiary of an approved Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker; or
Has been granted H-1B status under sections 106(a) and (b) of the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000 as amended by the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act (AC21).

U.S. businesses use the H-1B program to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require a bachelor’s or higher degree in a specific specialty that is directly related to the H-1B position. In addition to specialty occupation workers, the H-1B classification applies to individuals performing services related to a Department of Defense cooperative research and development project or coproduction project, and to individuals performing services of distinguished merit and ability in the field of fashion modeling.
Visit our H-1B Visa page for more information on eligibility for the H-1B program.
Eligibility Requirements
You are eligible if you are the H-4 dependent spouse of an H-1B nonimmigrant if your H-1B nonimmigrant spouse:
Is the principal beneficiary of an approved Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers; or
Has been granted H-1B status under sections 106(a) and (b) of the AC21. Under AC21, H-1B nonimmigrants seeking employment-based lawful permanent residence may be eligible to work and remain in the United States beyond the six-year H-1B period of admission limitation.

How to Apply
You must file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, to request employment authorization as an H-4 dependent spouse. You must receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD/Form I-766) from USCIS before you may begin working. Use the newest version of Form I-765 to prevent delays or the need for USCIS to issue you a request for evidence.
Carefully follow these steps to prevent your application from being rejected and returned to you:
If you are filing Form I-765 together with Form I-485, you must specify your eligibility category as (c)(9), not as (c)(26), and pay the Form I-485 filing fee. You do not have to pay the Form I-765 filing fee.  Follow the Form I-485 filing instructions to avoid processing delays.   
If you file a Form I-765 together with a Form I-485 at the filing address for Form I-765 category (c)(26), USCIS will reject your Form I-485 and any corresponding fees. Additionally, if you included the fees for both forms on the same check or money order, USCIS may also reject your Form I-765 for category (c)(26).

A copy of your current Form I-797 approval notice for Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status; or
A copy of Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, showing your admission as an H-4 nonimmigrant or your most recent approved extension of stay.

A copy of your last EAD (if any);
A copy of the biometric page of your passport;
A birth certificate with photo ID;
A visa issued by a foreign consulate; or
A national identity document with photo.

A copy of your marriage certificate.

You may show this by submitting a copy of the approval notice (Form I-797) for the Form I-140 filed for the H-1B nonimmigrant;

OR
You may show this by submitting:

Based on Filing of a Permanent Labor Certification Application. Submit evidence that the H-1B nonimmigrant is the beneficiary of a Permanent Labor Certification Application that was filed at least 365 days before the period of admission authorized under AC21 106(a) and (b) begins. You may show this by submitting a copy of a print out from the Department of Labor’s (DOL’s) website or other correspondence from DOL showing the status of the H-1B nonimmigrant’s Permanent Labor Certification Application. If more than 180 days have passed since DOL certified the Permanent Labor Certification Application, also submit a copy of Form I-797 Notice of Receipt for Form I-140 establishing that the Form I-140 was filed within 180 days of such DOL certification;

OR
Based on a Pending Form I-140. Submit evidence that the H-1B nonimmigrant’s Form I-140 was filed at least 365 days before the period of admission authorized under AC21 106(a) and (b) begins. You may show this by submitting a copy of the Form I-797, Notice of Receipt, for Form I-140.

If you do not have any evidence relating to the H-1B nonimmigrant as described in “a” or “b” above, you may ask USCIS to consider secondary evidence in support of your application for employment authorization as an H-4 spouse. For example, such information may include the receipt number of the most current Form I-129 extension of stay request filed for the H-1B nonimmigrant or the receipt number of the approved Form I-140 petition filed for the H-1B nonimmigrant. Failure to provide necessary information about the H-1B nonimmigrant may result in a delay in the adjudication or denial of your application for employment authorization.

The service center with jurisdiction over Form I-129. Please see our Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-129 web page for more information.
For your convenience, you may file Form I-765 with Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, or with both Form I-539 and the Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, filed for the H-1B principal nonimmigrant. However, we will not make a decision on your Form I-765 until after we have adjudicated your Form I-539 and determined whether you are eligible for the underlying H-4 nonimmigrant status, whether your spouse is eligible for the underlying H-1B nonimmigrant status, or both. Go to the Filing Form I-765 with Other Forms page for more information on filing these forms together
Validity of Employment Authorization
You will not be authorized to work until USCIS approves your Form I-765. Once your employment authorization is approved, the expiration date on your Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766 EAD) should be the same date as the expiration date on your most recent Form I-94 indicating your H-4 nonimmigrant status. Generally, you are only authorized to work through the expiration date on your EAD. If you are still eligible for employment authorization after that date, you should file for a renewal EAD by submitting another Form I-765. You cannot file for a renewal EAD more than 180 days before your original EAD expires
You may qualify for automatic extension of your existing employment authorization and accompanying EAD if you have properly filed an application to renew your H-4-based EAD before it expires, and you have an unexpired Form I-94 showing your status as an H-4 nonimmigrant. If you qualify for automatic extension of your current employment authorization and EAD, the automatic extension will continue until whichever comes first:
The end date on Form I-94 showing valid H-4 status;
The approval or denial of the EAD renewal application; or
180 days from the “Card Expires” date on the face of the existing EAD.

When applicable, acceptable evidence of your automatic extension of employment authorization that may be presented to employers for Form I-9 purposes includes the following combination of documents:
Form I-94 indicating the unexpired H-4 nonimmigrant status;
Form I-797C indicating a timely-filed renewal Form I-765 was filed under (c)(26); and
The expired EAD issued under the same category, Category C26.

Avoid Immigration Scams
Some unauthorized practitioners may try to take advantage of you by claiming they can file an EAD. These same individuals may ask that you pay them to file such forms. To learn the facts about how to protect yourself and your family from scams, please visit www.uscis.gov/avoidscams."

Extension of Post Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) and F-1 Status for Eligible Students under the H-1B Cap-Gap Regulations,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations-and-fashion-models/extension-of-post-completion-optional-practical-training-opt-and-f-1-status-for-eligible-students,"
ALERT: Although F-1 nonimmigrant students with degrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) may apply for a 24-month extension of their post-completion OPT employment authorization, our policies regarding the cap-gap extension remain the same. An F-1 student who is the beneficiary of a cap-subject H-1B petition and request for change of status that is filed on time may have their F-1 status and any current employment authorization extended until the first day of the new fiscal year.
The “cap-gap” period starts when an F-1 student’s status and employment authorization expires and, unless terminated, ends on Oct. 1, the required start date of the H-1B cap-subject petition filed on their behalf if seeking cap-gap authorization.
Cap-gap occurs because an employer may not file, and USCIS may not accept, a cap subject H-1B petition submitted more than six months in advance of the date of actual need for the beneficiary’s services or training. As a result, the earliest date that an employer can file an H-1B cap-subject petition is April 1 for the following fiscal year, which starts Oct, 1. If USCIS approves the H-1B petition and the accompanying change of status request, the earliest date that the student may start the approved H-1B employment is Oct. 1, but the beneficiary’s OPT employment authorization may expire before the H-1B start date.
Cap-Gap Extensions
Current regulations allow certain students with a pending or approved cap-subject H-1B petition to remain in F-1 status during the cap-gap period. This is referred to as filling the ""cap-gap,"" meaning the regulations provide a way of filling the ""gap"" between the end of F-1 status and the beginning of H-1B status that might otherwise occur were F-1 status not extended for qualifying students.
Eligibility for an Extension
Cap-subject H-1B petitions that are timely filed for an eligible F-1 student that request a change of status to H-1B on Oct. 1 qualify for a cap-gap extension.
Timely filed means that the H-1B petition (indicating change of status rather than consular processing) was filed during the applicable H-1B filing period, which begins April 1 and while the student's authorized F-1 duration of status (D/S) admission was still in effect (including any period of time during the academic course of study, any authorized periods of post-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT), and the 60-day departure preparation period commonly known as the ""grace period""). A cap-subject H-1B petition will not be considered to be properly filed unless it is based on a valid, selected registration for the same beneficiary and the appropriate fiscal year, unless the registration requirement is suspended.
Once the petitioner timely files a request to change status to H-1B on Oct. 1, the automatic cap-gap extension will begin. If the student’s H-1B petition is approved (or selected and approved if the registration requirement is suspended), the student’s cap-gap extension of status will continue through Sept. 30. The cap-gap extension of status will automatically terminate if the student’s H-1B petition is denied, withdrawn, revoked, rejected, or is not selected, or if the change of status request is denied or withdrawn even if the H-1B petition is approved for consular processing. The student will have the standard 60-day grace period from the date the extension of status terminated or their program end date, whichever is later, to depart the United States (however, the 60-day grace period does not apply to an F-1 student whose accompanying change of status request is denied or revoked due to a status violation, misrepresentation, or fraud).
Students are strongly encouraged to stay in close communication with their petitioning employer during the cap-gap extension period for status updates on the H-1B petition processing.
Please note: F-1 students who have entered the 60-day grace period are not authorized to work. If an H 1B cap-subject petition is properly filed for a student who has entered the 60-day grace period, the student will receive the automatic extension of his or her F-1 status, but will not be authorized to work since the student was not authorized to work at the time H-1B petition was filed.
Those Not Qualified for an Extension
F-1 students who do not qualify for a cap-gap extension and whose periods of authorized stay expire before Oct. 1 are required to leave the United States. They then need to apply for an H-1B visa at a consular post abroad, if applicable, and seek to be readmitted into the United States in H-1B status for the dates reflected on the approved H-1B petition.
Additionally, the cap-gap provision applies only to beneficiaries of cap-subject H-1B petitions, not to beneficiaries of cap-exempt H-1B petitions.
Proof of Continuing Status
The cap-gap extension of OPT is automatic for eligible students. A student does not file an application for the extension or receive a new Employment Authorization Document (EAD) to cover the additional time. The only proof of continued employment authorization currently available to an affected student is an updated Form I-20 showing an extension of OPT, issued to the student by their Designated School Official (DSO). This document serves as proof of continued employment authorization.
If a student chooses to obtain an updated Form I-20, they should provide their DSO with evidence of a timely-filed H-1B petition (indicating a request for change of status rather than for consular processing), such as a copy of the petition and a FedEx, UPS, or USPS Express/certified mail receipt. The student’s DSO will issue an updated Form I-20, showing an extension until June 1.
The student should return to their DSO with a copy of the petitioning employer’s Form I-797, Notice of Action, indicating that the petition was filed and accepted. The Form I-797 must have a valid receipt number. The student’s DSO will issue another updated Form I-20, showing an extension until Oct. 1. In such situations, the student can continue to work while the update to their Form I-20 is being processed. Because the cap-gap extension is automatic, the updated Form I-20 is not required for a student to continue working; it merely serves as proof of the extension of OPT employment authorization.
Denied H-1B Petitions
If an H-1B petition filed for an F-1 student with a cap-gap extension is denied, rejected, revoked, or withdrawn, the student will have the standard 60-day grace period (from the date of the notification of the denial, rejection, revocation, or withdrawal of the petition) to depart the United States.
The 60-day grace period does not apply to an F-1 student whose accompanying change of status request is denied due to a status violation, misrepresentation, or fraud. In such cases, the F-1 student is ineligible for cap-gap extension of status and the 60-day grace period. Similarly, the 60-day grace period and cap-gap extension of status does not apply to an F-1 student whose petition was revoked based on a finding of a status violation, fraud or misrepresentation discovered following approval. In both of these instances, students are required to immediately leave the United States.
Travel during Cap-Gap Extension Period
An F-1 student may generally travel abroad and seek readmission to the United States in F-1 status during a cap-gap period if:
However, if an F-1 student travels outside the United States while the H-1B petition and the change of status request remain pending the request for change of status will be considered abandoned.
Please note that even if an F-1 student meets all of the requirements listed above, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer always makes the final determination on whether to admit an applicant for admission after inspection at a port-of-entry. F-1 students may refer to the DHS Study in the States page for a list of the documents needed to confirm eligibility for F-1 status.
STEM OPT Extensions
F-1 students who receive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees included on the STEM Designated Degree Program List  (PDF), are employed by employers enrolled in and maintain good standing with E-Verify, and who have received an initial grant of post-completion OPT employment authorization related to such a degree, may apply for a 24-month extension of such authorization. F-1 students may obtain additional information about STEM OPT extensions on our Optional Practical Training Extension for STEM Students (STEM OPT) page or the STEM OPT Hub.
Students who are eligible for a cap-gap extension of post-completion OPT employment and F-1 status may apply for a STEM OPT extension during the cap-gap extension period.
However, students may not apply for a STEM OPT extension once the cap-gap extension period is terminated (if the H-1B petition is rejected, denied, revoked, or withdrawn) and the student has entered the 60-day grace period.
Unemployment Limits
The law allows you to be unemployed during your OPT period for a limited number of days.
Start Date Issues
If the student’s OPT end date is shortened to Sept. 30 even though their H-1B employment would not begin until a later date, the student should contact their DSO. The DSO may request a data fix in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) by contacting the SEVIS helpdesk.
Changes in Employment
Laid off or terminated by the H-1B employer: If the student has been approved to change their status to an H-1B nonimmigrant but is laid off/terminated by the H-1B employer before the date they officially obtain H-1B status, the student can retrieve any unused OPT if they have an unexpired EAD issued for post-completion OPT. The student will remain in F-1 status and can continue their OPT using the unexpired EAD.

The student also needs to make sure that USCIS receives a withdrawal request from the petitioner before the H-1B change of status goes into effect. This will prevent USCIS from changing the student’s status to H-1B. Once the petition has been revoked or withdrawn, the student must provide their DSO with a copy of the USCIS acknowledgement of withdrawal (the notice of revocation). The DSO may then contact the SEVIS helpdesk to request a data fix in SEVIS to prevent the student from being terminated in SEVIS.
If USCIS does not receive the withdrawal request before the date that the student is supposed to change status to an H-1B nonimmigrant, then the student will need to stop working, file Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, to request F-1 status, and wait until the change of status request is approved before resuming OPT employment.
The F-1 student can continue working with their approved EAD while the data fix in SEVIS is pending if:
The (former) H-1B employer withdrew the H-1B petition prior to Oct. 1
The student finds employment appropriate to their OPT;
The period of OPT is unexpired (which would indicate that the student was not actually utilizing “cap-gap” since they otherwise had valid OPT authorization); and
The DSO has requested a data fix in SEVIS.

While Waiting for a Data Fix in SEVIS
Working while the data fix is pending: If the employer withdraws the H-1B petition before Oct. 1, the student may continue working past Oct. 1 while the data fix remains pending so long as:

	The student finds employment appropriate to their OPT;
The period of OPT is unexpired (which would indicate that the student was not actually utilizing “cap-gap” since they otherwise had valid OPT authorization);; and
The student has not otherwise violated their F-1 status.

Maintaining valid F-1 status: If the employer withdraws the H-1B petition before the date that the student officially changes to H-1B status, the student generally will remain in F-1 status while the data fix is pending. The student would have the standard 60-day grace period to depart the United States unless the H-1B petition was revoked because of fraud or violation of status.

The student finds employment appropriate to their OPT;
The period of OPT is unexpired (which would indicate that the student was not actually utilizing “cap-gap” since they otherwise had valid OPT authorization);; and
The student has not otherwise violated their F-1 status.

If the employer withdraws the H-1B petition approval after the date that the student officially changes to H-1B status, the student’s status will have been changed from F-1 to H-1B. The student will no longer be in valid F-1 status and would need to file a Form I-539 if seeking to change back to F-1 status."
H-1B Electronic Registration Process,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations-and-fashion-models/h-1b-electronic-registration-process,"
Prospective petitioners seeking to file H-1B cap-subject petitions, including for beneficiaries eligible for the advanced degree exemption, must first electronically register and pay the associated $10 H-1B registration fee for each prospective beneficiary.
The electronic registration process streamlines processing by reducing paperwork and data exchange, and provides overall cost savings to employers seeking to file H-1B cap-subject petitions.
Under this process, prospective petitioners (also known as registrants), and their authorized representatives, who are seeking to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, complete a registration process that requires basic information about the prospective petitioner and each requested worker. The initial registration period for a minimum of 14 calendar days each fiscal year. The H-1B selection process is then run on properly submitted electronic registrations. Only those with selected registrations are eligible to file H-1B cap-subject petitions.
Selections take place after the initial registration period closes, so there is no requirement to register on the day the initial registration period opens. Creating an online account is easy; please see the videos below.
FY 2024 H-1B Cap Registration Process Update
As previously announced, on March 27, 2023, USCIS received enough electronic registrations during the initial registration period to reach the FY 2024 H-1B numerical allocations (H-1B cap), including the advanced degree exemption also known as the master’s cap.
During the registration period for the FY 2024 H-1B cap, USCIS saw a significant increase in the number of registrations submitted compared to prior years. Generally, we saw an increase in the number of registrations submitted, the number of registrations submitted on behalf of beneficiaries with multiple registrations, and the number of registrations submitted on behalf of unique beneficiaries with only one registration. USCIS saw upward trends in the FY 2022 and FY 2023 H-1B registration periods as well.
This chart shows registration and selection numbers for fiscal years 2021-2024 (as of April 24, 2023).
*The count of eligible registrations excludes duplicate registrations, those deleted by the prospective employer prior to the close of the registration period, and those with failed payments.
**The number of selections was smaller in FY 2024 than in prior years primarily due to (a) establishing a higher anticipated petition filing rate by selected registrants based on prior years; and (b) higher projected Department of State approvals of H-1B1 visas, which count against the H-1B cap.
Measures to Combat Fraud in the Registration Process
The large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple eligible registrations - much larger than in previous years – has raised serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. This may have unfairly increased their chances of selection. We remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the registration process, and to ensuring only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition.
We remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that:
All of the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct;
the registration(s) reflect a legitimate job offer; and
the registrant, or the organization on whose behalf the registration(s) is being submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.

If USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct, USCIS will find the registration to not be properly submitted and the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted.
Furthermore, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action, as appropriate.
Based on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, USCIS has already undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and is in the process of initiating law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution.
The H-1B program is an essential part of our nation’s immigration system and our economy, and USCIS is committed to implementing the law and helping meet the ever-changing needs of the U.S. labor market. We are working on an upcoming H-1B modernization rule that will propose, among other improvements, bolstering the H-1B registration process to reduce the possibility of misuse and fraud in the H-1B registration system.

For more information about the H-1B program, visit our H-1B Specialty Occupations webpage.
In order to submit an H-1B registration, you must first create a USCIS online account.
The initial registration period for FY 2024 will open at noon Eastern on March 1 and run through noon Eastern on March 17. Both representatives and registrants must wait until March 1 to create and submit H-1B registrations.
Prospective petitioners (also known as registrants) must use a “registrant” account within myUSCIS to submit registrations. After they select “I am an H-1B registrant” account type, registrants will not be able to add additional information until the initial registration period opens. Registrants submitting their own registrations will enter their company information as part of their first H-1B registration. Registrants working with a representative will review company information that their representatives enter. Please see the video below for instructions about setting up registrant accounts.
Representatives can create an account at any time by using the same kind of account already available to representatives. Representatives who already have a representative account may use that account; they do not need to create a new account. Unlike registrants, representatives enter information about their law firm or organization as part of setting up an account. Please see the video below for instructions about setting up an attorney or representative account.
Registering online is quick and easy!
If you are a prospective petitioner (registrant), view the video below for steps on how to submit registrations without the use of an attorney or representative.
If you are an attorney or representative, view the video below for steps on how to submit registrations for your clients.
Based on our experience with the H-1B electronic registration period, the top two user errors are:
Creating the wrong type of account; and
Entering the same beneficiary more than once.

Make Sure You Create the Right Type of Account
There are three types of USCIS online accounts:
Avoid Duplicate Entries
A prospective petitioner may only have one registration submitted per beneficiary per fiscal year. Once the initial registration period has closed, if the prospective petitioner has more than one registration submitted for the same beneficiary, we will invalidate all registrations submitted for that beneficiary by that prospective petitioner, or their authorized attorney or representative, from the selection process. This does not prevent other prospective petitioners or their representatives from submitting registrations for that same beneficiary, but they too need to ensure that each prospective petitioner only has one registration submitted for the beneficiary.
USCIS has added duplicate checker functionality to the electronic registration process. Before you submit your registration(s), you can check if the registrant named in the draft submission previously submitted a registration for any of the beneficiaries included in that draft submission for the same fiscal year. Using this check does not guarantee that you will not submit a duplicate. This check will compare the beneficiaries listed in the draft with any registrations previously submitted during this registration period. It will not check for duplicates within that draft or between drafts. Even if using this check function, the burden is still on the registrant and their authorized attorney or representative, if applicable, to ensure that no duplicate registrations are submitted. To that end, USCIS also provides a tool to download a .csv file and search for duplicate entries. Also, we recommend that attorneys and authorized individuals who work for the same company coordinate to eliminate duplicates before submitting their registrations.
If you discover you or your representative submitted more than one registration for the same person and the initial registration period is still open (before noon Eastern on March 17, 2023), you can go into your account and delete the extra submission(s) until there is only one registration for the beneficiary. We do not refund the $10 fee if you delete a duplicate registration.
If you discover that you or your representative submitted more than one registration for the same person and the initial registration period has closed (after noon Eastern on March 17, 2023), there is no way to correct this error. We will remove all registrations submitted for the beneficiary by, or on behalf of, that prospective petitioner from the selection process. We do not refund the $10 fee for a removed registration.
When you submit your registration(s), you must attest, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the submission is complete, true, and correct.  Beginning in FY 2023, the attestation that is required before submission indicates, “I further certify that this registration (or these registrations) reflects a legitimate job offer and that I, or the organization on whose behalf this registration (or these registrations) is being submitted, have not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.”
If USCIS finds that this attestation was not true and correct (for example, that a company worked with another entity to submit multiple registrations for the same beneficiary to unfairly increase chances of selection for that beneficiary), USCIS will find that registration to not be properly submitted. Since the registration was not properly submitted, the prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration in accordance with the regulatory language at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(1). USCIS may deny or revoke a petition based on a registration that contained a false attestation and was therefore not properly submitted. Furthermore, USCIS may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action as appropriate.
$10 for each registration. Each registration is for a single beneficiary.
Registrants or their representative are required to pay the $10 non-refundable H-1B registration fee for each beneficiary before being eligible to submit a registration for that beneficiary for the H-1B cap.
The U.S. Department of Treasury has approved a temporary increase in the daily credit card transaction limit from $24,999.99 to $39,999.99 per day for the FY 2024 H-1B cap season. This temporary increase is in response to stakeholder feedback and the volume of previous H-1B registrations that exceeded the daily credit card limit.
There is a daily transaction limit for credit cards of $24,999.99 per credit card per day. Alternatively, you can:
Process transactions using a checking account. The checking account information (routing and account number) must be from a financial institution located in the United States; or
Process transactions using a debit card from a financial institution located in the United States.

You can continue to use a credit card, limiting your daily credit card transactions to a total of $39,999.99 per card.

Registration Selection Notifications
USCIS intends to notify registrants and their representatives with selected registrations via their USCIS online accounts.
A registrant’s USCIS online account will show one of the following statuses for each registration:
Submitted: The registration has been submitted and is eligible for selection. If the initial selection process has been completed, this registration remains eligible, unless subsequently invalidated, for selection in any subsequent selections for the fiscal year for which it was submitted.
Selected: Selected to file an H-1B cap petition.
Not Selected: Not selected – not eligible to file an H-1B cap petition based on this registration.
Denied: Multiple registrations were submitted by or on behalf of the same registrant for the same beneficiary. If denied as a duplicate registration, all registrations submitted by or on behalf of the same registrant for this beneficiary for the fiscal year are invalid.
Invalidated-Failed Payment: A registration was submitted but the payment method was declined, not reconciled, disputed, or otherwise invalid.

H-1B cap-subject beneficiaries, including those eligible for the advanced degree exemption, must have a valid “Selected” registration notification for that specific fiscal year in order for a registrant or representative to properly file an H-1B cap-subject petition. The status of registrations that are not selected as part of any initial random selection process, and not denied or invalidated, will remain as “Submitted.” Registrants and representatives that are not selected will not be notified until after USCIS has determined that they have reached the H-1B cap for that fiscal year.
H-1B Electronic Registration Frequently Asked Questions
Q1. Is there an appeal process for registrations that USCIS finds are invalid duplicates?
A1. Registrations that we find are duplicates will be invalid. A registrant will not be able to appeal our finding that the registrations are duplicates.
Q2. If registering for the master’s cap based on the expectation that the beneficiary will earn a qualifying advanced degree and the registration is selected under the master’s cap, but the beneficiary does not obtain their qualifying advanced degree by the time of filing the cap-subject H-1B petition, is there a risk that USCIS will deny the cap-subject H-1B petition for that beneficiary?
A2. If we select a registration under the advanced degree exemption (under INA 214(g)(5)(C)) because the beneficiary has earned, or will earn prior to the filing of the petition, a master’s or higher degree from a U.S. institution of higher education, the beneficiary must be eligible for the advanced degree exemption at the time of filing Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker. If we select the beneficiary under the advance degree exemption and the beneficiary has not earned a qualifying master’s or higher degree from a U.S. institution of higher education at the time of filing the petition, we will deny or reject the petition.
Q3. What happens if the prospective employer with a selected registration puts an address on their registration but moves before they file their I-129 petition, such that the addresses on their registration and Form I-129 don’t match?
A3. In such a situation, the petitioner should include a statement with their petition, with supporting documentation, explaining why the address on the registration differs from the address on the petition. If we cannot determine that the petitioning entity is the same as the prospective petitioner identified on the selected registration, we may reject or deny the petition.
Q4. What start date should petitioners with a selected registration indicate on their Form I-129?
A4. If we selected your registration, you must indicate a start date of Oct. 1, 2023, or later (and six months or less from the receipt date of the petition) on your petition. If you do not, we will reject or deny your petition.
Q5. If there is a typo on the registration in comparison to the Form I-129, will USCIS reject the Form I-129 petition?
A5. Although we will not automatically reject the Form I-129 petition for typos on the selected registration in comparison with the Form I-129, the burden is on the registrant/petitioner to confirm that all registration and petition information is correct and to establish that the H-1B cap petition is based on a valid registration submitted for the beneficiary named in the petition and selected by USCIS.
Q6. Will the H-1B registration system affect how USCIS handles the prohibited filing of multiple H-1B petitions for the same beneficiary by related entities?
A6. The prohibition on an employer or related entities filing multiple H-1B cap petitions for the same beneficiary has not changed. Our handling of multiple H-1B cap petitions is consistent with 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(G) and Matter of S- Inc., Adopted Decision 2018-02 (AAO Mar. 23, 2018).
Q7. Where should a petitioner with a selected registration file their Form I-129 and supporting documentation?
A7. Petitioners must file at the location indicated on the H-1B registration selection notice, which may be different from the historical Form I-129 filing jurisdictions for cap cases. We have updated our Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, webpage to show that petitioners must file at the service center listed on their selection notice.
Q8. What happens if a legal representative submits a registration but then stops representing the registrant?
A8. It is up to the representative and registrant to ensure that the registrant maintains access to submissions made for them and any updates related to those submissions. If a registrant no longer wants their attorney involved, they can end the relationship with the representative, and the registrant will still be able to see all registration information in their own registrant account(s). However, the registrant will not be able to add a new attorney or representative to H-1B registrations prepared or submitted by the previous attorney.
Q9. If a prospective petitioner submits registrations for unrelated beneficiaries who happen to have the same name, date of birth, and no passport numbers, would USCIS consider those registrations duplicates?
A9. Yes. If a prospective petitioner submits two registrations for people with the same name, date of birth, and no passport number, we will consider the registrations duplicates and, therefore, invalid. Registrants must provide the passport numbers or affirmatively indicate that the beneficiary does not have a passport number. Passport numbers should help to avoid the scenario described in the question. We analyze the data of submitted registrations for fraud trends, and we may refer registrants who abuse or attempt to abuse the system to federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action.
Q10. Will the system prevent the representative and the registrant from both entering the same beneficiary?
A10. The system will not prevent a representative and a registrant from both registering the same beneficiary. However, we added duplicate checker functionality to the electronic registration process. Before you submit your registration(s), you can check whether the registrant named in the draft submission previously submitted a registration for any of the beneficiaries included in that draft submission for the same fiscal year. Using this check does not guarantee that you will not submit a duplicate. This check will compare the beneficiaries listed in the draft with any registrations previously submitted during this registration period. It will not check for duplicates within that draft or between drafts. Even when using this check function, the representative and the registrant still are responsible for ensuring that they do not submit duplicate registrations. To help with that, we also offer a tool to download a .csv file and search for duplicate entries. In addition, we recommend that attorneys and authorized individuals who work for the same company communicate among themselves to eliminate duplicates before submitting their registrations.
Q11. I am a legal representative submitting the H-1B registration online, and the Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, asks if I have an online account and what my account number is. How do I find it?
A11. If you have paper-filed cases that are eligible to be added to your online account, your USCIS notices for those cases should include your online account number. If you do not know your account number, this will not affect your H-1B registration. You can click “No” to this question and move on to the next question.
Q12. If I have an existing applicant myUSCIS account, do I have to create an H-1B registrant account? What happens to my old account? Do I need to use a new email address to set up the H-1B registrant account?
A12. Yes, you will need to create a new account. The existing applicant account type will not work for H-1B electronic registration. You will need to use a new email address to set up the H-1B registrant account type.
Q13. What if I choose the wrong account type when I am creating a USCIS online account? Will I be able to change it to the correct account type later?
A13. No. You will not be able to switch to a different account type yourself once you make an initial selection. Please choose the correct account type—H-1B Registrant or Legal Representative, as applicable—when you create your account. Only these two account types will work with the H-1B electronic registration process. If you choose the wrong account type, you may use a new email address to create a new account in myUSCIS and choose the correct account type. Alternatively, there are a few instances where the registrant or legal representative account may be deleted. Please see the steps outlined in the Tips for Filing Forms Online page to see if your account qualifies. You can visit the H-1B Electronic Registration Process page to read instructions, view videos, and download step-by-step presentations about the different account types and how to set up an account.
Q14. Will both the attorney and the client (prospective registrant) need to create a USCIS online account for the H-1B electronic registration process?
A14. Yes. Both the client (prospective registrant) and attorney will need a USCIS online account for the H-1B electronic registration process. If you are an attorney and already have an existing legal representative account, your account will work with the H-1B electronic registration process. You do not need to create a new legal representative account unless you do not have one.
All clients (prospective registrants) will need to create an H-1B registrant account to review and approve the Form G-28 and H-1B registrations as part of the electronic registration process.
Q15. As a registrant, can I delete my account?
A15. See the Tips for Filing Forms Online webpage for information on how to delete your account.
Q16. Does a duplicate registration in a submission batch affect all registrations in the batch or only the duplicate registration?
A16. We would invalidate only the duplicate registrations. If you properly submitted other registrations for different beneficiaries, these valid registrations would remain in the system for the selection process. You have until March 17, while the initial registration period is still open, to log into your account, review all of your H-1B registrations, and delete any duplicate registrations. This is also true if one of the registrations submitted in a batch contains an error. You would be able to delete the registration for the beneficiary that contained the error without affecting the rest of the batch submission.
Q17. Do you send the Form G-28 client passcode to the registrant?
A17. No. We do not send the client passcode directly to the registrant. When the legal representative submits the Form G-28, the system generates the registrant passcode. The legal representative will need to share this passcode with the registrant, so the registrant can add that individual as a representative and review and approve the draft H-1B registration and Form G-28.
Q18. Will the system generate a new one-time code that the legal representative sends to the registrant each time the legal representative goes into the system to view or edit the Form G-28? Or will the registrant use the same code that was generated at the initial creation of the Form G-28 each time they log in to review or edit it?
A18. The unique code generated when you create the Form G-28 remains on your homepage. If you log out and log in again later, you will be able to view that same code that you will need to provide to the registrant (your client). It does not change. If you create a new Form G-28, the system will generate a new passcode for the new Form G-28.
Q19. As a legal representative, how will I know that the registrant has gone into the system and approved my Form G-28 and the H-1B registrations?
A19. You can log into your account to check if the registrant has approved the Form G-28 and the H-1B registrations. Our system will not separately notify you that the registrant has approved the Form G-28 and H-1B registrations.
Q20. After the legal representative submits a registration, will the registrant be notified via email or by logging into their account?
A20. The legal representative will need to notify the registrant that the registration and Form G-28 were entered for the registrant’s review; or the registrant can see the registrations and Form G-28 by logging into their account. Our system will not separately notify the registrant.
Q21. Can an attorney represent a petitioner for an I-129 petition if the petitioner completed the H-1B electronic registration process without the help of the attorney?
A21. Yes. However, to authorize their representation, the attorney would need to file a Form G-28 with the Form I-129 H-1B petition. Even if the attorney submitted a Form G-28 to represent a registrant for the registration process, they would still need to submit a new Form G-28 with the Form I-129 petition.
Q22. How do I reset the password for my USCIS account or get technical support?
A22. To reset your password, please visit the Forgot Your Password page on our website. To review the steps on how to create an online account, sign into your account, or complete an H-1B registration with USCIS, visit the H-1B Electronic Registration Process page. If you need other technical support, please call the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283. You may also use our online form, but you will get faster service by calling.
Q23. What is the earliest date I can start drafting registrations?
A23. March 1, 2023, at noon Eastern.
Q24. Will the system allow for multiple staff members to log into my account at the same time?
A24. No. You must agree to the Terms of Use, which include an attestation that you are the person that holds the account and that you will not share your account with others or allow others to use your account.
Q25. How should a registrant with a selected registration notify USCIS if they do not intend to file a petition?
A25. Since no H-1B petition will be filed, we will have no paper file that we can use to match the notification with the registration. We suggest that the employer keep documentation of the reason for not filing, so that the employer would be able to show us the documentation if we have questions.
Q26. If a registration is selected and the petition is filed during the 90-day period, but it is rejected, will a petitioner be eligible to refile if they are still within the 90-day window?
A26. A petitioner is eligible to refile their rejected petition as long as it is refiled within the designated 90-day filing window. The petitioner should file their petition at the service center indicated on their selection notice and must include all required fees and supporting evidence with the filing.
Q27. Will USCIS invalidate registrations as duplicates if the same representative submits two registrations for the same beneficiary, but for two unrelated companies?
A27. No. We would not consider such registrations duplicates. However, we will consider registrations as duplicates if the registrations are for the same prospective petitioners and the same prospective beneficiaries.
Furthermore, we would consider a registration to not be properly submitted if it contained an attestation that was not true and correct (for example, that a company worked with another entity to submit multiple registrations for the same beneficiary to unfairly increase chances of selection for that beneficiary). For more information, please see the “Unfairly Increasing Chances of Selection” tab above.
Q28. If one person is the authorized signatory for two separate companies, could this person use their email with different domain names to set up a registrant account and submit registrations for the two companies?
A28. Yes, they may. They will need two separate accounts, one for each company. They will also need a separate email address for each account.
Q29. What happens to my registration submission if the payment fails to initially go through?
A29. If your payment initially fails or is canceled before it can be processed on Pay.gov, you will see a payment failure notification on the screen and your registration will not be submitted. Your registration data will be available in your account for 30 days from the date you last worked on your registrations. You can sign-in to your account at any time before the initial registration period closes at noon Eastern on March 17, 2023, to try the payment and registration submission again. You must submit all registrations and payments successfully before noon Eastern, March 17, 2023, for consideration in the initial registration period selection process.
Q30. What happens if my payment initially clears, but then fails (for example, payment is made using an electronic check that my bank then returns)?
A30. It is your responsibility to submit valid payment.
When paying by check, please be sure to enter the bank routing number and bank account number accurately. While the status of the registration in the system will indicate “submitted” following completion of the Pay.gov payment process, the submission will only be valid once your payment clears. If your checking information is not accurate, your payment will be declined when presented to your financial institution. If your payment is declined, your H-1B registration will be invalidated.
If payment is completed with a credit card or debit card, the status of the registration in the system will indicate “submitted” following completion of the Pay.gov payment process. The submission, however, will only be valid once processing of the payment is completed. If the payment is later declined, rejected, disputed, or canceled after submission, the registration will be invalidated.
If your payment fails, we will attempt to notify you, but the burden will be on you to determine the status of your required payment. If your registration is invalidated while the registration period is still open, you will be able to submit a new registration with a valid payment. If your registration is invalidated due to a failed payment after the registration period closes, you will not be able to submit a new registration. Registrations can be submitted and paid for until the registration period closes at noon Eastern on March 17, 2023.
Q31. The Form G-28 client passcode does not work when the client tries to enter it. There is an error message that indicates an email mismatch or invalid passcode. Why is this occurring?
A31. Prospective petitioners (registrants) must create registrant accounts for H-1B registration and, if submitting registrations through a representative, must enter the case access passcode from their representatives to connect the accounts and submit the registrations. When filling out the Form G-28, the representative must enter the same email address the registrant used when creating their USCIS account. If the representative entered an incorrect email address for the registrant, the representative could recall the Form G-28 by clicking the “Recall G-28 for edits” button at the bottom of the account homepage. The recall feature is available to the representative once the client has reviewed the registrations but before the client attempts to link to the representative account. The recall feature is not available if the client has attempted to link the account.
Q32. What happens if an attorney represents a company that has several offices throughout the United States that all have the same employer identification number but different human resources contacts (signatory representatives for each of the offices or departments). How does the attorney set them up as a client and allow the contact for each division to sign for submissions of employees in their division? Does the client need to provide only one company contact for all their offices?
A32. The attorney can designate multiple authorized officials in a client company. The company would need to have the individuals at each office create their own registrant account for which they are authorized to sign. The attorney would then be able to send the registrations to the relevant authorized official for that submission.
Q33. May an authorized signatory within the company, who is different from the authorized signatory who signed the H-1B electronic registration, sign the paper Form I-129?
A33. Yes. The authorized signatory who signed the registration does not need to be the same authorized signatory who signs the Form I-129. However, the prospective petitioner (registrant) at the registration stage must match the petitioner at the Form I-129 stage.

H-1B Registration Final Rule
"
H-1B Cap Season,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations-and-fashion-models/h-1b-cap-season,"
The H-1B program allows companies and other employers in the United States to temporarily employ foreign workers in occupations that require the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and a bachelor’s degree or higher in the specific specialty, or its equivalent. H-1B specialty occupations may include fields such as architecture, engineering, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences, medicine and health, education, business specialties, accounting, law, theology, and the arts. For more information about the H-1B program, visit our H-1B Specialty Occupations webpage.
We use the information provided during the electronic registration process to help us determine if a petition is subject to the congressionally mandated cap of 65,000 H-1B visas (commonly known as the “regular cap”) or the advanced degree exemption. The advanced degree exemption is an exemption from the H-1B cap for beneficiaries who have earned a U.S. master’s degree or higher and is available until the number of beneficiaries who are exempt on this basis exceeds 20,000.
Congress set the current annual regular cap for the H-1B category at 65,000. Not all H-1B nonimmigrant visas (or status grants) are subject to this annual cap. Please note that up to 6,800 visas are set aside from the 65,000 each fiscal year for the H-1B1 program under the terms of the legislation implementing the U.S.-Chile and U.S.-Singapore free trade agreements. Unused visas in this group become available for H-1B use for the next fiscal year’s regular H-1B cap.
H-1B workers performing labor or services in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and Guam may also be exempt from the H-1B cap (see the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 (CNRA), Public Law 110-229). H-1B workers in Guam and the CNMI are exempt from the H-1B cap if their employers file the petition before Dec. 31, 2029.
H-1B cap-subject petitions, including those eligible for the advanced degree exemption, may not be filed unless based on a valid and selected registration for the beneficiary named in the petition (unless the registration requirement is suspended).
You may file an H-1B petition no more than six months before the employment start date requested for the beneficiary. The specific filing period and filing location for your petition will be located on your H-1B Registration Selection Notice or on the USCIS website in the event the registration requirement is suspended.
Note: It is your responsibility to ensure that Form I-129 is completed accurately and submitted properly.
Labor Condition Application (LCA)
When filing your H-1B petition with USCIS, you must include evidence that an LCA (ETA 9035) has been certified by the U.S. Department of Labor. This may include a copy of the signed, certified LCA. (Note: USCIS encourages petitioners to keep Department of Labor LCA processing times in mind when preparing the H-1B petition and to plan accordingly.) If the LCA was previously submitted in a petition that has been approved, you must submit a list including the name and USCIS case receipt number of any foreign worker who has previously used the LCA. You may not use an LCA for more workers than specified in Part B, Question 7 of the LCA.
Please see the Department of Labor’s Office of Foreign Labor Certification website for more information on the LCA process.
Evidence of Beneficiary’s Educational Background
You must submit evidence of the beneficiary’s education credentials (with English translations when applicable) at the time you file your petition. If the beneficiary has met all of the requirements for a degree, but the degree has not yet been awarded, you may submit the following alternate evidence:
A copy of the beneficiary’s final transcript; or
A letter from the registrar confirming that the beneficiary has met all of the degree requirements. If the educational institution does not have a registrar, then the letter must be signed by the person in charge of educational records where the degree will be awarded.

If you indicate that the beneficiary is qualified based on a combination of education and experience, please provide substantiating evidence at the time you file your petition.
Petitioners may not file multiple or duplicative H-1B petitions for the same beneficiary. To ensure fair and orderly distribution of available H-1B visas, we will deny or revoke multiple or duplicative petitions filed by an employer (including its related entities) for the same H-1B worker and will not refund the filing fees. Multiple or duplicative petitions will be denied or revoked even if they are filed pursuant to a selected registration. For additional information, please see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(G); PM-602-0159, Matter of S- Inc., Adopted Decision 2018-02 (AAO Mar. 23, 2018)  (PDF, 123.38 KB).
You must file your petition with the correct service center, as indicated on your Registration Selection Notice. We have specific mailing addresses for cases that are subject to the H-1B cap. To determine the correct mailing address for the service center named on your Registration Selection Notice, see our Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker page.
Please read the filing instructions carefully. If you file your petition at the wrong location, we may reject it. Rejected petitions will not retain a filing date. If your petition is rejected because it was filed at the wrong location, you may refile your rejected petition with the correct service center as long as the petition is refiled during the designated 90-day filing window on your Registration Selection Notice.
There are different fees depending on the type of H-1B petition you are submitting. Please refer to the H and L Filing Fees for Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker page for detailed instructions on H-1B fees. All petitioners must pay a base filing fee for each petition filed. Go to the Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker web page for the current filing fee amount.
The U.S. Department of Treasury has approved a temporary increase in the daily credit card transaction limit from $24,999.99 to $39,999.99 per day for the FY 2024 H-1B cap season. This temporary increase is in response to stakeholder feedback and the volume of previous H-1B registrations that exceeded the daily credit card limit.
In addition to the base filing fee, you may need to pay one of the following fees for a petition subject to the cap:
American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (ACWIA) fee:
$750 for employers with one to 25 full-time equivalent employees, unless exempt
$1,500 for employers with 26 or more full-time equivalent employees, unless exempt

The ACWIA fee information is available in Section 2 of the H-1B and H-1B1 Data Collection and Filing Fee Exemption Supplement on pages 19-21 of Form I-129.
Fraud Prevention and Detection fee:
$500 to be submitted with a request for initial H-1B status or with a request for a beneficiary already in H-1B status to change employers. (This fee does not apply to Chile/Singapore H-1B1 petitions.)

Public Law 114-113 fee:
$4,000 for petitioners who:
	Employ 50 or more employees in the United States and more than 50% of those employees are in H-1B or L-1 nonimmigrant status. You must submit this fee with a request for initial H-1B status or a request for a beneficiary already in H-1B status to change employers.


Employ 50 or more employees in the United States and more than 50% of those employees are in H-1B or L-1 nonimmigrant status. You must submit this fee with a request for initial H-1B status or a request for a beneficiary already in H-1B status to change employers.

Checks
Check must be:
Payable to the Department of Homeland Security;
Include the proper amount and signature.

We prefer that you submit a separate check for each fee. For example, if you are required to pay the base filing fee, the fraud fee, and the ACWIA fee, you should submit three separate checks. If you only submit one check as combined payment for all applicable fees and certain fees do not apply or are incorrect, we will reject your H-1B petition.
Money Orders
Money orders must be properly endorsed.
Incorrect Filing Fee
We will reject all petitions submitted with the incorrect filing fee.
Premium processing is currently available for all H-1B petitions. Additional information is available on our How Do I Request Premium Processing? page.
Preferred order of documents at time of submission:
How to mail multiple petitions together
If you will include multiple petitions in the same package, please place the individual petitions into separate envelopes within the package.
Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative
If you will be represented by an attorney or other accredited representative, submit a properly completed Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative. For further information on Form G-28, please see our Filing Your Form G-28 page.
Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker
Complete all required sections of the form accurately and in accordance with the regulations and form instructions.
H-1B cap petitions and advanced degree exemption petitions for the FY 2024 cap must include an employment start date of no earlier than Oct. 1, 2023. You must indicate a start date of Oct. 1, 2023 or later (and six months or less from the receipt date of the petition) on your petition or your petition will be rejected or denied. Do not file petitions earlier than six months before the requested employment start date. We will reject H-1B petitions requesting a start date of “As Soon As Possible” or “ASAP.”
Ensure that you have entered the “Beneficiary Confirmation Number” on the H Classification Supplement (Page 13, Question 5).
Ensure that the petition is properly signed.
Petitioners should enter their own address in Part 1, question 3 of the Form I-129. This will ensure that the I-797 receipt and approval notices are sent to the petitioner.
While not required information if the beneficiary is outside the United States, you may include the beneficiary’s passport number on Form I-129. The passport number, when available and included on Form I-129, may help USCIS to confirm that the beneficiary named in the registration notice is the same individual as the beneficiary named in the petition and avoid processing delays.
Ensure that the beneficiary’s name is spelled properly and that their date of birth is displayed in the proper format (mm/dd/yyyy). Also, review the country of birth and citizenship and the I-94 number (if applicable) for accuracy.
Ensure that any information provided during the electronic registration process matches the information provided on the petition. If information between the registration and petition does not match, the petition may be rejected or denied. If any information does not match, you should provide a written explanation and supporting documentation as to why there was a change or why the information does not match.
If the beneficiary is seeking an extension of stay or change of status, the petition should include evidence (such as a Form I-94 or Form I-797 approval notice) to establish that the beneficiary will have maintained a valid nonimmigrant status through the employment start date being requested.
Include a copy of the beneficiary’s valid passport.

H Classification Supplement to Form I-129

H-1B and H-1B1 Data Collection and Filing Fee Exemption Supplement
You can find the H-1B and H-1B1 Data Collection and Filing Fee Exemption Supplement beginning on page 19 of Form I-129.
Please be sure to complete all sections of the form accurately.
Make sure you are filing a valid edition of Form I-129, as specified in the Edition Date section on the Form I-129 page.

If you filed an H-1B cap petition in a timely manner, but received notification from the delivery service that suggests that there may be a delay or damage to the package or that the package was misrouted, you may file a second H-1B petition with a new fee payment during the designated 90-day filing window on your Registration Selection Notice and the following:
An explanation as to why a second petition is being filed, with supporting evidence, such as the notice from the delivery service; and
A request to withdraw the first petition filed for the H-1B cap.

If you do not include these items, you will be considered to have submitted duplicate petitions. USCIS will deny or revoke multiple or duplicative petitions filed by the same petitioner, for the same H-1B worker in the same fiscal year, and will not refund the filing fees.
If you properly file a second H-1B petition and withdraw the first, USCIS will withdraw the first petition and proceed with adjudication of the second petition.
When we receive a timely and properly filed H-1B cap subject petition, the petitioner (and, if applicable, the petitioner’s legal representative) will be provided a Form I-797, Notice of Action, communicating receipt of the petition. Due to increased filing volumes typically seen during H-1B cap filing periods, there are instances where a petition is timely and properly filed, but issuance of the Form I-797 is delayed. If a petitioner has confirmation from the delivery service that the petition was delivered, but they have not yet received a Form I-797 confirming receipt of the petition, the petitioner should not submit a second petition. If a petitioner has confirmation from the delivery service that the petition was delivered, and they submit a second petition, the petitioner will be considered to have submitted duplicate petitions. This will result in the denial or revocation of both petitions."

This nonimmigrant classification applies to people who wish to perform services in a specialty occupation, services of exceptional merit and ability relating to a Department of Defense (DOD) cooperative research and development project, or services as a fashion model of distinguished merit or ability.
Theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge; and
Attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States.

The position must also meet one of the following criteria to qualify as a specialty occupation:
Bachelor’s or higher degree or its equivalent is normally the minimum entry requirement for the particular position
The degree requirement is common to the industry in parallel positions among similar organizations or, in the alternative, the job is so complex or unique that it can be performed only by an individual with a degree
The employer normally requires a degree or its equivalent for the position
The nature of the specific duties is so specialized and complex that the knowledge required to perform the duties is usually associated with the attainment of a bachelor’s or higher degree.*

For you to qualify to perform services in a specialty occupation you must meet one of the following criteria:
Hold a U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree required by the specialty occupation from an accredited college or university
Hold a foreign degree that is the equivalent to a U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree required by the specialty occupation from an accredited college or university
Hold an unrestricted state license, registration, or certification that authorizes you to fully practice the specialty occupation and be immediately engaged in that specialty in the state of intended employment

Have education, specialized training, and/or progressively responsible experience that is equivalent to the completion of a U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree in the specialty occupation, and have recognition of expertise in the specialty through progressively responsible positions directly related to the specialty.**
Yes. The prospective petitioner must include a Form ETA-9035/9035E, Labor Condition Application (LCA) certified by the Department of Labor (DOL), with the Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker. See the DOL’s Office of Foreign Labor Certification.
For more information see the Information for Employers and Employees page.
DOD Researcher and Development Project Worker
The job must require a bachelor’s or higher degree, or its equivalent, to perform the duties. The petition must be accompanied by:
To be eligible for this classification you must have a bachelor's or higher degree or its equivalent in the occupational field in which you will be performing services. This requirement can be met based on one of the following criteria:
Hold a U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree required by the duties from an accredited college or university
Hold a foreign degree that is the equivalent to a U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree from an accredited college or university
Hold an unrestricted state license, registration, or certification that authorizes you to fully practice the duties of the job and be immediately engaged in that specialty in the state of intended employment
Have education, specialized training, or progressively responsible experience in the specialty that is equivalent to the completion a U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree, and have recognition of expertise in the specialty through progressively responsible positions directly related to the specialty.**

H-1B3
Fashion Model
The position/services must require a fashion model of prominence.
To be eligible for this visa category you must be a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability.
*For more information, see 8 CFR §214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A). “Normally,” “common,” and “usually” are interpreted based on their plain language, dictionary definitions. They are not interpreted to mean “always.” 
**For more information see 8 CFR §214.2(h)(4)(iii)(C).
Some professions require an H-1B beneficiary to hold a state or local license authorizing the beneficiary to fully practice the specialty occupation.
If an occupation in the state of intended employment requires such a license, an H-1B beneficiary seeking classification in that occupation generally must have that license before the petition is approved, rather than at the time of filing the petition. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(v)(A)–(B). When a license is required, but there is no evidence of the beneficiary holding one, USCIS will generally issue a request for evidence of the required license.
In 2020, we implemented an electronic registration process for the H-1B cap. A cap-subject H-1B petition will not be considered to be properly filed unless it is based on a valid, selected registration for the same beneficiary and the appropriate fiscal year, unless the registration requirement is suspended. For more information about the H-1B registration process, visit our H-1B Electronic Registration Process webpage.
Petition Filing Process
Step 1: (only required for specialty occupation and fashion model petitions): Employer/Agent Submits LCA to DOL for Certification.
The employer/agent must apply for and receive DOL certification of an LCA. For further information regarding LCA requirements and DOL's process, see the Foreign Labor Certification, Department of Labor page.
Step 2: Employer/Agent Submits Completed Form I-129 to USCIS.
The employer/agent should file Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, with the correct USCIS service center. Please see our I-129 Direct Filing Chart page. The DOL-certified LCA should be submitted with the Form I-129 (only for specialty occupation and fashion models). See the instructions to the Form I-129 (PDF, 641.66 KB) for additional filing requirements.
Step 3: Prospective Workers Outside the United States Apply for Visa and/or Admission.
Once the Form I-129 petition has been approved, the prospective H-1B worker who is outside the United States may apply with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad for an H-1B visa (if a visa is required). Regardless of whether a visa is required, the prospective H-1B worker must then apply to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for admission to the United States in H-1B classification.
Prospective specialty occupation and distinguished fashion model employers/agents must obtain a certification of an LCA from the DOL. This application includes certain attestations, a violation of which can result in fines, bars on sponsoring nonimmigrant or immigrant petitions, and other sanctions to the employer/agent. The application requires the employer/agent to attest that it will comply with the following labor requirements:
The employer/agent will pay the H-1B worker a wage which is no less than the wage paid to similarly qualified workers or, if greater, the prevailing wage for the position in the geographic area in which the H-1B worker will be working.
The employer/agent will provide working conditions that will not adversely affect other similarly employed workers.
At the time of the labor condition application there is no strike or lockout at the place of employment.
Notice of the filing of the labor condition application with the DOL has been given to the union bargaining representative or has been posted at the place of employment.

As an H-1B specialty occupation worker or fashion model, you may be admitted for a period of up to three years. Your time period may be extended, but generally cannot go beyond a total of six years, though some exceptions do apply under sections 104(c) and 106(a) of the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act (AC21), 8 CFR 214.2(h)(13)(iii)(D) and (E).
Your employer will be liable for the reasonable costs of your return transportation if your employer terminates your employment before the end of your period of authorized stay. Your employer is not responsible for the costs of your return transportation if you voluntarily resign from your position.
The H-1B classification has an annual numerical limit (cap) of 65,000 new statuses/visas each fiscal year. An additional 20,000 petitions filed on behalf of beneficiaries with a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. institution of higher education are exempt from the cap. Additionally, H-1B workers who are petitioned for or employed at an institution of higher education or its affiliated or related nonprofit entities, a nonprofit research organization, or a government research organization, are not subject to this numerical cap.
For further information about the numerical cap, see our H-1B Cap Season page.
Changing Employers or Employment Terms with the Same Employer (Portability)
Changing Employers
When can I begin working for a new H-1B employer if I change employers?
If you are changing H-1B employers, you may begin working for the new employer as soon as they properly file a non-frivolous Form I-129 petition on your behalf, or as of the requested start date on that petition, whichever is later.
To  be eligible for portability, you must not have been employed without authorization from the time of your last admission into the United States, and your new employer must properly file a new, non-frivolous petition before your H-1B period of authorized stay expires.

Will I still have employment authorization if I change employers?
If you are eligible for H-1B portability, your employment is authorized until USCIS has made a decision on the Form I-129.
If the new I-129 petition is approved, you may continue working for the new employer for the period of time indicated on the new petition approval.
If the new petition is denied, you may continue working for your previous employer if your prior period of authorized employment is still valid, but your authorization to work based on portability ceases upon denial of the petition.
If you are laid off, fired, quit, or otherwise cease employment with your previous employer, you may have up to 60 consecutive days or until the end of your authorized validity period, whichever is shorter, to find new employment, change status, or depart the country.

Can I move from cap-exempt to cap-subject employment?
If you are moving from cap-exempt to cap-subject employment, your new employer’s H‑1B petition will be subject to the H-1B cap.  If subject to the cap, your new employer must first submit an electronic registration when registration period opens. This is typically in March.
If more registrations are submitted than projected as needed to meet the cap for a given fiscal year, registrations are selected by a random selection process. If the registration your employer submitted on your behalf is selected, they may file a petition for you with a start date of Oct. 1 (or later).
You may begin working under the new, cap-subject petition after the new employer properly files a non-frivolous Form I-129 petition on your behalf, or as of the requested start date on that petition, whichever is later.
If you are currently employed in a cap-exempt position, you may engage in concurrent employment in a cap-subject position as long as you will continue to be employed in the cap-exempt position. You may begin working concurrently for the cap-subject employer as soon as they properly file a non-frivolous Form I-129 petition on your behalf, or as of the requested start date on that petition, whichever is later. As long as you continue your cap-exempt employment, were previously counted toward the cap, or otherwise remain cap exempt, you will not become subject to the H-1B cap again during the same H-1B validity period.

Changing Employment Terms with the Same Employer
What if I want to start new employment or change employment terms with my current employer?
Form I-129 is also used to request new employment or a change of employment with the same employer.
If your current H-1B employer properly files a non-frivolous Form I-129 requesting new employment or a change of employment on your behalf, you are authorized to work according to the terms of the new or changed employment once that petition is filed, or as of the requested start date on that petition, whichever is later.

Your spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age may seek admission in the H-4 nonimmigrant classification. Beginning May 26, 2015, certain H-4 dependent spouses of H-1B nonimmigrants can file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, as long as the H-1B nonimmigrant has already started the process of seeking employment-based lawful permanent resident status. Please visit our Employment Authorization for Certain H-4 Dependent Spouses page to learn more.
USCIS reached a settlement agreement (PDF, 268.06 KB) in the case of MadKudu Inc., et al. v. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, et al., No. 20-cv-2653 (N.D. Cal.). On Oct. 19, 2021, the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division, granted final approval of the settlement agreement. This agreement outlines new, overarching guidance for adjudicating pending or future H-1B petitions for market research analysts.
Additionally, the agreement allows class members to submit a Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, to request that certain denied Forms I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, seeking H-1B classification for a market research analyst be reopened and adjudicated per the terms of the settlement agreement. No fee will be charged for such a request. Class members have until April 26, 2022, to submit a Form I-290B.
Class members eligible to submit a Form I-290B are those that:
Filed a Form I-129 H-1B petition between Jan. 1, 2019, and Oct. 19, 2021, for a market research analyst.
USCIS denied the petition based on a finding that the Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH) entry for a market research analyst did not establish that the occupation is a specialty occupation, and thus did not satisfy 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1).
If not for this finding, the petition would have been approved.
There is any amount of time remaining on the period specified in the certified Labor Condition Application (LCA) originally submitted with the underlying Form I-129 at the time that the Form I-290B is filed.

Class members whose eligible Form I-129 was denied may submit their Form I-290B (without fee) on or before April 26, 2022, to have their reopening request and, if eligibility is established, their underlying I-129 H-1B petition adjudicated per the terms of the settlement agreement.
USCIS will make a decision on all eligible, timely-filed reopening requests within 90 days of our receipt of the physical file at the adjudicating office. USCIS will attempt to prioritize reopening requests for petitions with LCAs expiring less than 90 days after the Form I-290B is properly filed with USCIS.
If we determine that the underlying petition is not eligible for this reopening process, in accordance with the bullets above (for example, you are not a class member eligible to submit a Form I-290B under the settlement agreement), we will reject the Form I-290B.
Filing Instructions
All Forms I-290B must be submitted to the Nebraska Service Center, on or before April 26, 2022, at the addresses below.
When submitting Form I-290B, you should:
The petition was filed on or after Jan. 1, 2019, through Oct. 19, 2021, (for cases in which the denial does not include the filing date of the petition, you should submit a copy of USCIS’ receipt notice for the petition).
USCIS found that the job fell within the market research analyst occupation;
USCIS considered the OOH entry for market research analysts;
USCIS found that the market research analyst occupation was not a specialty occupation under the first regulatory criterion at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1); and
The sole basis for the denial was that the position was not within a specialty occupation.

Questions about Same or Similar Occupational Classifications Under the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000 (AC21)
Frequently Asked Questions about Part 6 of Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker 
"
How USCIS Determines Same or Similar Occupational Classifications for Job Portability Under AC21,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/how-uscis-determines-same-or-similar-occupational-classifications-for-job-portability-under-ac21,"
If you have a pending Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status based on employment, you may be able to change the job or employer on which your Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker, is based as long as the new job offer is in the same or a similar occupational classification as the job offer for which the Form I-140 petition was filed. For you to change the offer of employment or employer, your Form I-485 must have been pending with USCIS for 180 days or more. You may request to “port” your job offer using the Form I-485, Supplement J, Confirmation of Bona Fide Job Offer or Request for Job Portability Under INA Section 204(j). See section 204(j) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which was enacted from section 106(c) of the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000 (AC21), for more information.
The term “port” or “porting” means to change the offer of employment from one job or employer to another job or employer in a way that allows an applicant to remain eligible for a Green Card without having a new Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker filed, for the applicant.
Occupational Classifications
The Department of Labor (DOL) uses the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system to group and classify jobs and occupations. The purpose of the SOC system is to organize occupational data and classify workers into distinct occupational categories. The SOC system covers all occupations where work is performed for pay or for profit. Occupations are generally categorized based on the type of work performed. Additionally, certain occupations are also classified based on the skills, education and training required to perform the job.
The SOC system is organized using codes, which generally consist of six numerical digits. For example, the SOC code for a stonemason is 47-2022.
[47]-2022: The first two digits, “47” represent the major group, which includes all construction and extraction occupations.
47-[2]022: The third digit, “2” represents the minor group, which includes all construction trade workers.
47-2[02]2: The fourth and fifth digits, “02” represent the broad occupation, which includes brick masons, block masons, and stonemasons.
47-202[2]: The sixth digit, “2” represents the detailed occupation, which only includes stonemasons.
	47-0000 Construction and Extraction Occupations
47-2000 Construction Trades Workers
47-2020 Brick masons, Block masons, and Stonemasons
47-2022 Stonemasons


47-0000 Construction and Extraction Occupations
47-2000 Construction Trades Workers
47-2020 Brick masons, Block masons, and Stonemasons
47-2022 Stonemasons

No occupation will be assigned to more than one category with six digits.
The USCIS Policy Manual [7 USCIS-PM E.5] instructs USCIS officers that they may refer to DOL’s SOC system in making portability determinations. It also instructs officers to consider additional resources such as DOL’s Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook as well as the DOL’s Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Employment Statistics Database as part of the analysis.
How USCIS Determines a Same or Similar Occupational Classification
USCIS officers consider multiple factors when deciding if two jobs are in similar occupational classifications for job porting purposes. USCIS officers may compare factors including, but not limited to:
DOL’s SOC system
The job duties of both positions
The skills, experience, education, training, licenses or certifications specifically required to perform each job
The SOC code from the Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker, the ETA Form 9089, Application for Permanent Employment Certification  (PDF) (if applicable), and the appropriate SOC code for the new position as identified on the I-485 Supplement J
The wages associated with each position
Any other relevant and credible evidence submitted by the applicant

USCIS officers will consider the totality of the circumstances to determine if the two jobs are the same or similar for porting purposes and make our determination based upon a preponderance of the evidence.
USCIS Does Not Simply Compare Numbers in the SOC Code
As noted above, USCIS does not use a simple numerical comparison of SOC codes to determine if two jobs are the same or similar. USCIS aims to determine in all cases whether a new position is in the same or similar occupational classification as the original job offer. When referring to the SOC system, USCIS will analyze the SOC codes of the two jobs it is comparing. However, there is no specific rule for matching any particular order of digits in two SOC codes.
In the example in the Occupational Classifications section above, the “47” encompasses all construction and extraction occupations, which is a broad category and would not determine whether two jobs are similar. In this particular example, even matching additional digits of the SOC codes may not show whether or not two jobs are similar.
For example, the SOC code for a stonemason is 47-2022. The job description for a stonemason is:
Build stone structures, such as piers, walls, and abutments. Lay walks, curbstones, or special types of masonry for vats, tanks, and floors.
The SOC code for a boilermaker is 47-2010, which contains the same first four numbers of the stonemason’s SOC code (47-20). However, the job description for a boilermaker is significantly different from that of stonemason:
Construct, assemble, maintain, and repair stationary steam boilers and boiler house auxiliaries. Align structures or plate sections to assemble boiler frame tanks or vats, following blueprints. Work involves use of hand and power tools, plumb bobs, levels, wedges, dogs, or turnbuckles. Assist in testing assembled vessels. Direct cleaning of boilers and boiler furnaces. Inspect and repair boiler fittings, such as safety valves, regulators, automatic-control mechanisms, water columns, and auxiliary machines.
In reviewing two positions within the same broad occupational classification, USCIS will consider factors such as the similarity of the duties, experience, or areas of study associated with each position.
How Wages Factor into USCIS’ Determination
The USCIS Policy Manual [7 USCIS-PM E.5] indicates that USCIS may consider the wages offered for the original position and the new position when determining whether the two positions meet the requirements for job portability. However, USCIS will not necessarily conclude that the two positions are the same or similar based solely on whether the wages are the same or not. USCIS takes into consideration factors such as normal raises that occur over time to account for inflation or promotion, the fact that the two positions might be located in different geographic locations or economic sectors, possible corporate mergers that could affect compensation structures, as well as moving from a for-profit to a non-profit employer (or moving from a non-profit to a for-profit employer).
If You Change Jobs or Get Promoted
If you change jobs or receive a promotion, USCIS will determine whether you remain eligible for a Green Card on a case-by-case basis and based upon the totality of the circumstances. You must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the relevant positions are in similar occupational classifications. For example, if you move into a more senior but related position which is non-managerial, USCIS will use the criteria explained above to determine whether you are primarily responsible for managing the same or similar functions of your original job or the work of persons whose jobs are in the same or similar occupational classification(s) as your original position.

"
E-3 Specialty Occupation Workers from Australia,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/e-3-specialty-occupation-workers-from-australia,"
The E-3 classification applies only to nationals of Australia. You must be coming to the United States solely to perform services in a specialty occupation. The specialty occupation requires theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty, or its equivalent, as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States.
Eligibility Criteria
To qualify for an E-3 visa, you must demonstrate, among other things, that you:
Are a national of Australia
Have a legitimate offer of employment in the United States
Possess the necessary academic or other qualifying credentials
Will fill a position that qualifies as a specialty occupation

Applying for an E-3 Visa from Within the United States
The Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker, is used to apply for a change of status to or an extension of stay in the E-3 nonimmigrant temporary worker classification.
Supporting Documents
Your Form I-129 should include the following documents:
A Labor Condition Application (LCA) that indicates that it has been filed to support an E-3 classification
Academic or other credentials demonstrating qualifications for the position
Job offer letter or other documentation from the employer establishing that you will be engaged in a specialty occupation and that you will be paid the higher of the actual or prevailing wage
If required, before you may commence employment in the specialty occupation, you must have the necessary license or other official permission to practice in the specialty occupation

Period of Stay/Extension of Stay
Change of Employer
To change employers while remaining in the United States your new employer must obtain a certified Labor Condition Application for the position in which you will be employed and properly file a Form I-129 petition. The Form I-129 petition must be approved before you are authorized to work for the new employer. USCIS may consider you to be maintaining E-3 status, following cessation of employment, for up to 60 days during the period of petition validity (or other authorized validity period).
Note: Form I-129 is also used to apply for an extension of stay or change of employment with the same employer.
Family of E-3 Nonimmigrant Workers
An E-3 nonimmigrant worker’s spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age are entitled to dependent E-3 classification. Children of E-3 workers may not be employed in the United States.
Spouses of E-3 workers in valid E-3 or E-3S status are considered employment authorized incident to status.
DHS-issued evidence of such employment authorization, particularly that may be presented to employers for completion of Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, include:
Certain E spouses qualify for the automatic extension of their existing Form I-766 EADs if they meet the following conditions:
They timely filed a renewal Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, based on the same E nonimmigrant status; and
They have an unexpired Form I-94 showing their status as an E-3, E-3D, E-3R, or E-3S nonimmigrant.

Normally, DHS regulations provide for an automatic extension period of up to 180 days from the expiration date stated on the EAD. However, DHS has published a temporary final rule increasing the automatic extension period. Effective May 4, 2022, DHS is temporarily increasing the automatic extension period and providing up to 360 days of additional automatic extension time, for a total of up to 540 days, to eligible renewal applicants. The automatic EAD extension will therefore continue until whichever comes first:
The end date on the dependent spouse’s Form I-94 showing valid L-2 or L-2S nonimmigrant status, as applicable;
The date we approve or deny their application to renew the previous EAD; or
540 days from the “Card Expires” date on the front of the previous EAD.

Additional information on the temporary increase of the automatic extension period is available on the Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension page.
Eligible E nonimmigrant spouses may present the following evidence of the automatic EAD extension to employers for Form I-9 purposes:
Form I-94 indicating the unexpired E-3, E-3D, E-3R, or E-3S nonimmigrant status;
Form I-797C for a timely-filed EAD renewal application (Form I-765) stating “Class requested” as “(a)(17)”; and

The expired EAD issued under the same category, Category A17.

E-2 Treaty Investors,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/e-2-treaty-investors,"
ALERT: As of Dec. 23, 2022, Section 101 (a)(15)(E) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) was amended to define the eligibility criteria for E visas. See Section 5902 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, Pub. L. 117-263, December 23, 2022, 136 Stat 2395. For all E-1 and E-2 filings received on or after Dec. 23, 2022, USCIS may request additional documentation related to how the applicant obtained treaty country nationality to ensure compliance with the amended language. In addition, for those individuals who obtained treaty country nationality through a financial investment, USCIS may require additional documentation to show that the applicant has been domiciled in the treaty country indicated in the application for a continuous period of at least 3 years at any point before applying for E-1 or E-2 classification. The current text of the statute is as follows:
      
(E) an alien entitled to enter the United States under and in pursuance of the provisions of a treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and the foreign state of which the alien is a national, or, in the case of an alien who acquired the relevant nationality through a financial investment and who has not previously been granted status under this subparagraph, the foreign state of which the alien is a national and in which the alien has been domiciled for a continuous period of not less than 3 years at any point before applying for a nonimmigrant visa under this subparagraph, and the spouse and children of any such alien if accompanying or following to join such alien;
      
The E-2 nonimmigrant classification allows a national of a treaty country (a country with which the United States maintains a treaty of commerce and navigation, or with which the United States maintains a qualifying international agreement, or which has been deemed a qualifying country by legislation) to be admitted to the United States when investing a substantial amount of capital in a U.S. business. Certain employees of such a person or of a qualifying organization may also be eligible for this classification. (For dependent family members, see “Family of E-2 Treaty Investors and Employees” below.)

See U.S. Department of State's Treaty Countries for a current list of countries with which the United States maintains a treaty of commerce and navigation.

If the treaty investor is currently in the United States in a lawful nonimmigrant status, they may file Form I-129 to request a change of status to E-2 classification. If the desired employee is currently in the United States in a lawful nonimmigrant status, the qualifying employer may file Form I-129 to request a change of status to E-2 classification on the employee’s behalf.
    
A request for E-2 classification may not be made on Form I-129 if you are physically outside the United States. Interested parties should refer to the U.S. Department of State website for further information about applying for an E-2 nonimmigrant visa abroad. Upon issuance of a visa, the person may seek admission at a United States port of entry as an E-2 nonimmigrant.
    
To qualify for E-2 classification, the treaty investor must:
    
Be a national of a country with which the United States maintains a treaty of commerce and navigation;
Have invested, or be actively in the process of investing, a substantial amount of capital in a bona fide enterprise in the United States; and
Be seeking to enter the United States solely to develop and direct the investment enterprise. This is established by showing at least 50% ownership of the enterprise or possession of operational control through a managerial position or other corporate device.


investment is the treaty investor’s placing of capital, including funds and/or other assets, at risk in the commercial sense with the objective of generating a profit. The capital must be subject to partial or total loss if the investment fails. The treaty investor must show that the funds have not been obtained, directly or indirectly, from criminal activity.  See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(12) for more information. 
      
A substantial amount of capital is:
    
Substantial in relationship to the total cost of either purchasing an established enterprise or establishing a new one
Sufficient to ensure the treaty investor’s financial commitment to the successful operation of the enterprise
Of a magnitude to support the likelihood that the treaty investor will successfully develop and direct the enterprise. The lower the cost of the enterprise, the higher, proportionately, the investment must be to be considered substantial.

A bona fide enterprise refers to a real, active, and operating commercial or entrepreneurial undertaking which produces services or goods for profit. It must meet applicable legal requirements for doing business within its jurisdiction.
    
The investment enterprise may not be marginal. A marginal enterprise is one that does not have the present or future capacity to generate more than enough income to provide a minimal living for the treaty investor and his or her family. Depending on the facts, a new enterprise might not be considered marginal even if it lacks the current capacity to generate such income. In such cases, however, the enterprise should have the capacity to generate such income within five years from the date that the treaty investor’s E-2 classification begins. See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(15).
    
To qualify for E-2 classification, the employee of a treaty investor must:
    
Be the same nationality of the principal alien employer (who must have the nationality of the treaty country);
Meet the definition of “employee” under relevant law; and
Either be engaging in duties of an executive or supervisory character, or if employed in a lesser capacity, have special qualifications.

If the principal alien employer is not an individual, it must be an enterprise or organization at least 50% owned by persons in the United States who have the nationality of the treaty country. These owners must either: (a) be maintaining nonimmigrant treaty investor status or (b) if the owners are not in the United States, they must be, if they were to seek admission to this country, classifiable as nonimmigrant treaty investors.  See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(3)(ii).
    
Duties that are of an executive or supervisory character are those which primarily provide the employee ultimate control and responsibility for the enterprise’s overall operation, or a major component of it.  See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(17) for a more complete definition.
    
Special qualifications are skills and/or aptitudes which make the employee’s services essential to the efficient operation of the treaty enterprise. There are several qualities or circumstances that could, depending on the facts, meet this requirement. These include, but are not limited to:
    
The degree of proven expertise in the employee’s area of operations
Whether others possess the employee’s specific skills
The salary that the special qualifications can command
Whether the skills and qualifications are readily available in the United States.

Knowledge of a foreign language and culture does not, by itself, meet this requirement. Note that in some cases a skill that is essential at one point in time may become commonplace, and therefore no longer qualifying, at a later date.  See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(18) for a more complete definition.
    
Qualified treaty investors and employees will be allowed a maximum initial stay of two years. Requests for extension of stay in, or changes of status to, E-2 classification may be granted in increments of up to two years each. There is no limit to the number of extensions an E-2 nonimmigrant may be granted. All E-2 nonimmigrants, however, must maintain an intention to depart the United States when their status expires or is terminated.
    
An E-2 nonimmigrant who travels abroad may generally be granted, if determined admissible by a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Officer, an automatic two-year period of readmission when returning to the United States. 
    
A treaty investor or employee may only work in the activity for which he or she was approved at the time the classification was granted. An E-2 employee, however, may also work for the treaty organization’s parent company or one of its subsidiaries as long as the:
    
Relationship between the organizations is established;
Subsidiary employment requires executive, supervisory, or essential skills; and
Terms and conditions of employment have not otherwise changed.

See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(8)(ii) for details.
    
USCIS must approve any substantive change in the terms or conditions of E-2 status. A “substantive change” is defined as a fundamental change in the employer’s basic characteristics that would affect the alien’s eligibility for E classification, such as, but not limited to:
    
A merger;
Acquisition;
Sale of the division where the alien is employed; or
Other event that affects the treaty investor or employee’s previously approved relationship with the treaty enterprise. 

Where there has been such a substantive change, the treaty investor or enterprise, if it wishes to continue to employ the alien in E-2 status, must notify USCIS by filing a new Form I-129 with fee, and may simultaneously request an extension of stay for the treaty investor or affected employee. The Form I-129 must include evidence to show that the treaty investor or affected employee continues to qualify for E-2 classification. An employer who no longer employs an E-2 nonimmigrant is urged to inform USCIS of this upon termination of the E-2 nonimmigrant’s employment.
    
A treaty investor is not required to file a new Form I-129 to notify USCIS about non-substantive changes. A treaty investor or E-2 employee enterprise may seek advice from USCIS, however, to determine whether a change is considered substantive.  To request advice, the treaty investor or enterprise must file Form I-129 with fee and a complete description of the change.
    
See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(8) for more information on terms and conditions of E-2 treaty investor status.
    
A strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage at the intended place of employment may affect a Canadian or Mexican treaty investor or employee’s ability to obtain E-2 status. See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(22) for details.
    
Treaty investors and employees may be accompanied or followed by spouses and unmarried children who are under 21 years of age. Their nationalities need not be the same as the treaty investor or employee. Spouses and children may seek E-2 nonimmigrant classification as dependents and, if approved, generally will be granted the same period of stay as the employee.  If the family members are already in the United States and are seeking changes of status to or extensions of stay in an E-2 dependent classification, they may apply by filing a single Form I-539, Application to Change/Extend Nonimmigrant Status, with fee.
    
Spouses of E-2 workers in valid E-2 or E-2S status are considered employment authorized incident to status, except for spouses of long-term investors in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (E-2 CNMI Investors) who are required to apply for employment authorization per 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(12).
    
DHS-issued evidence of such employment authorization, particularly that may be presented to employers for completion of Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, include:
    
Certain E spouses qualify for the automatic extension of their existing Form I-766 EADs if they meet the following conditions:
    
They timely filed a renewal Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, based on the same E nonimmigrant status; and
They have an unexpired Form I-94 showing their status as an E-2 or E-2S nonimmigrant.

Normally, DHS regulations provide for an automatic extension period of up to 180 days from the expiration date stated on the EAD. However, DHS has published a temporary final rule increasing the automatic extension period. Effective May 4, 2022, DHS is temporarily increasing the automatic extension period and providing up to 360 days of additional automatic extension time, for a total of up to 540 days, to eligible renewal applicants. The automatic EAD extension will therefore continue until whichever comes first:
    
The end date on the dependent spouse’s Form I-94 showing valid L-2 or L-2S nonimmigrant status, as applicable;
The date we approve or deny their application to renew the previous EAD; or
540 days from the “Card Expires” date on the front of the previous EAD.

Additional information on the temporary increase of the automatic extension period is available on the Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension page.
    
Eligible E spouses may present the following evidence of the automatic EAD extension to employers for Form I-9 purposes:
    
Form I-94 indicating the unexpired E-2 or E-2S nonimmigrant status;
Form I-797C for a timely-filed EAD renewal application (Form I-765) stating “Class requested” as “(a)(17)”; and
The expired EAD issued under the same category, Category A17.

As discussed above, the E-2 treaty investor or employee may travel abroad and will generally be granted an automatic two-year period of readmission when returning to the United States. Unless the family members are accompanying the E-2 treaty investor or employee at the time the latter seeks readmission to the United States, or the family members separately travel abroad and return to the United States within the new readmission period, the new readmission period will not apply to the family members. To remain lawfully in the United States, family members must carefully note the period of stay they have been granted in E status and apply for an extension of stay before their own validity expires.

"
E-1 Treaty Traders,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/e-1-treaty-traders,"
ALERT: As of Dec. 23, 2022, Section 101 (a)(15)(E) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) was amended to define the eligibility criteria for E visas. See Section 5902 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, Pub. L. 117-263, December 23, 2022, 136 Stat 2395. For all E-1 and E-2 filings received on or after Dec. 23, 2022, USCIS may request additional documentation related to how the applicant obtained treaty country nationality to ensure compliance with the amended language. In addition, for those individuals who obtained treaty country nationality through a financial investment, USCIS may require additional documentation to show that the applicant has been domiciled in the treaty country indicated in the application for a continuous period of at least 3 years at any point before applying for E-1 or E-2 classification. The current text of the statute is as follows:
(E) an alien entitled to enter the United States under and in pursuance of the provisions of a treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and the foreign state of which the alien is a national, or, in the case of an alien who acquired the relevant nationality through a financial investment and who has not previously been granted status under this subparagraph, the foreign state of which the alien is a national and in which the alien has been domiciled for a continuous period of not less than 3 years at any point before applying for a nonimmigrant visa under this subparagraph, and the spouse and children of any such alien if accompanying or following to join such alien;
The E-1 nonimmigrant classification allows a national of a treaty country (a country with which the United States maintains a treaty of commerce and navigation, or which the United States maintains a qualifying international agreement, or which has been deemed a qualifying country by legislation) to be admitted to the United States solely to engage in international trade on his or her own behalf. Certain employees of such a person or of a qualifying organization may also be eligible for this classification. (For dependent family members, see “Family of E-1 Treaty Traders and Employees” below.)
See U.S. Department of State's Treaty Countries for a current list of countries with which the United States maintains a treaty of commerce and navigation.
Who May File for Change of Status to E-1 Classification
If the treaty trader is currently in the United States in a lawful nonimmigrant status, they may file Form I-129 to request a change of status to E-1 classification. If the desired employee is currently in the United States in a lawful nonimmigrant status, the qualifying employer may file Form I-129 on the employee’s behalf.
How to Obtain E-1 Classification if Outside the United States
A request for E-1 classification may not be made on Form I-129 if you are physically outside the United States. Interested parties should refer to the U.S. Department of State website for further information about applying for an E-1 nonimmigrant visa abroad. Upon issuance of a visa, the person may seek admission at a United States port of entry as an E-1 nonimmigrant.
General Qualifications of a Treaty Trader
To qualify for E-1 classification, the treaty trader must:
Be a national of a country with which the United States maintains a treaty of commerce and navigation or with which the United States maintains a qualifying international agreement, or which has been deemed a qualifying country by legislation;
Carry on substantial trade; and
Carry on principal trade between the United States and the treaty country which qualified the treaty trader for E-1 classification.

Trade is the existing international exchange of items of trade for consideration between the United States and the treaty country. Items of trade include but are not limited to:
Goods
Services
International banking
Insurance
Transportation
Tourism
Technology and its transfer
Some news-gathering activities.

See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(9) for additional examples and discussion.
Substantial trade generally refers to an amount of trade sufficient to ensure a continuous flow of international trade items between the United States and the treaty country. The continuous flow contemplates numerous transactions over time. There is no minimum requirement regarding the monetary value or volume of each transaction. While monetary value of transactions is a relevant factor in considering substantiality, greater weight is given to more numerous exchanges of greater value. For smaller businesses, the income derived from the value of numerous transactions which is sufficient to support the treaty trader and their family is a favorable factor. See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(10) for further details.
Principal trade between the United States and the treaty country exists when over 50% of the volume of international trade of the treaty trader is between the United States and the treaty country of the treaty trader’s nationality. See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(11).
General Qualifications of the Employee of a Treaty Trader
To qualify for E-1 classification, the employee of a treaty trader must:
Be the same nationality of the principal noncitizen employer (who must have the nationality of the treaty country)
Meet the definition of “employee” under relevant law
Either be engaging in duties of an executive or supervisory character, or if employed in a lesser capacity, have special qualifications that make the employee’s services essential to the efficient operation of the treaty enterprise.

If the principal noncitizen employer is not an individual, it must be an enterprise or organization at least 50% owned by persons in the United States who have the nationality of the treaty country. These owners must either: (a) be maintaining nonimmigrant treaty trader status or (b) if the owners are not in the United States, they must be, if they were to seek admission to this country, classifiable as nonimmigrant treaty traders. See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(3)(ii).
Duties which are of an executive or supervisory character are those that primarily provide the employee ultimate control and responsibility for the treaty enterprise’s overall operation, or a major component of it. See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(17) for a more complete definition.
Special qualifications are skills and/or aptitudes which make the employee’s services essential to the efficient operation of the treaty enterprise. There are several qualities or circumstances that could, depending on the facts, meet this requirement. These include, but are not limited to:
The degree of proven expertise in the employee’s area of operations
Whether others possess the employee’s specific skills
The salary that the special qualifications can command
Whether the skills and qualifications are readily available in the United States

Knowledge of a foreign language and culture does not, by itself, meet this requirement. Note that in some cases a skill that is essential at one point in time may become commonplace, and therefore no longer qualifying, at a later date. See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(18) for a more complete definition.
Period of Stay
Qualified treaty traders and employees will be allowed a maximum initial stay of two years. Requests for extension of stay in, or changes of status to, E-1 classification may be granted in increments of up to two years each. There is no limit to the number of extensions an E-1 nonimmigrant may be granted. All E-1 nonimmigrants, however, must maintain an intention to depart the United States when their status expires or is terminated.
An E-1 nonimmigrant who travels abroad may generally be granted, if determined admissible by a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Officer , an automatic two-year period of readmission when returning to the United States.
Terms and Conditions of E-1 Status
A treaty trader or employee may only work in the activity for which he or she was approved at the time the classification was granted. An E-1 employee, however, may also work for the treaty organization’s parent company or one of its subsidiaries as long as the:
Relationship between the organizations is established;
Subsidiary employment requires executive, supervisory, or essential skills; and
Terms and conditions of employment have not otherwise changed.

See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(8)(ii) for details.
USCIS must approve any substantive change in the terms or conditions of E-1 status. A “substantive change” is defined as a fundamental change in the employer’s basic characteristics that would affect the noncitizen’s eligibility for E classification, such as, but not limited to
a merger;
Acquisition;
sale of the division where the noncitizen is employed; or
other event that affects the treaty trader or employee’s previously approved relationship with the treaty enterprise.

Where there has been such a substantive change, the treaty trader or enterprise, if it wishes to continue to employ the noncitizen in E-1 status, must notify USCIS by filing a new Form I-129 with fee, and may simultaneously request an extension of stay for the treaty trader or affected employee. The petition must include evidence to show that the treaty trader or affected employee continues to qualify for E-1 classification. An employer who no longer employs an E-1 nonimmigrant is urged to inform USCIS of this upon termination of the E-1 nonimmigrant’s employment.
A treaty trader is not required to file a new Form I-129 to notify USCIS about non-substantive changes. A treaty trader or E-1 employee enterprise may seek advice from USCIS, however, to determine whether a change is considered substantive. To request advice, the treaty trader or enterprise must file Form I-129 with fee and a complete description of the change.
See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(8) for more information on terms and conditions of E-1 treaty trader status.
A strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage at the intended place of employment may affect a Canadian or Mexican treaty trader or employee’s ability to obtain E-1 status. See 8 CFR 214.2(e)(22) for details.
Family of E-1 Treaty Traders and Employees
Treaty traders and employees may be accompanied or followed by spouses and unmarried children who are under 21 years of age. Their nationalities need not be the same as the treaty trader or employee. Spouses and children may seek E-1 nonimmigrant classification as dependents and, if approved, generally will be granted the same period of stay as the employee. If the family members are already in the United States and seeking changes of status to or extensions of stay in an E-1 dependent classification, they may apply by filing a single Form I-539, Application to Change/Extend Nonimmigrant Status, with fee.
Spouses of E-1 workers in valid E-1 or E-1S status are considered employment authorized incident to status, except for spouses of employees of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) and Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices (TECO), who continue to be required to apply for employment authorization per 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(2).
DHS-issued evidence of such employment authorization, particularly that may be presented to employers for completion of Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, include:
Certain E spouses qualify for the automatic extension of their existing Form I-766 EADs if they meet the following conditions:
They timely filed a renewal Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, based on the same E nonimmigrant status; and
They have an unexpired Form I-94 showing their status as an E-1 or E-1S nonimmigrant.

Normally, DHS regulations provide for an automatic extension period of up to 180 days from the expiration date stated on the EAD. However, DHS has published a temporary final rule increasing the automatic extension period. Effective May 4, 2022, DHS is temporarily increasing the automatic extension period and providing up to 360 days of additional automatic extension time, for a total of up to 540 days, to eligible renewal applicants. The automatic EAD extension will therefore continue until whichever comes first:
The end date on the dependent spouse’s Form I-94 showing valid L-2 or L-2S nonimmigrant status, as applicable;
The date we approve or deny their application to renew the previous EAD; or
540 days from the “Card Expires” date on the front of the previous EAD.

Additional information on the temporary increase of the automatic extension period is available on the Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension page.
Eligible E spouses may present the following evidence of the automatic EAD extension to employers for Form I-9 purposes:
Form I-94 indicating the unexpired E-1 or E-1S nonimmigrant status;
Form I-797C for a timely-filed EAD renewal application (Form I-765) stating “Class requested” as “(a)(17)”; and
The expired EAD issued under the same category, Category A17.

As discussed above, the E-1 treaty trader or employee may travel abroad and will generally be granted an automatic two-year period of admission when returning to the United States. Unless the family members are accompanying the E-1 treaty trader or employee at the time the latter seeks admission to the United States, or the family members separately travel abroad and return to the United States within the new readmission period, the new readmission period will not apply to the family members. To remain lawfully in the United States, family members must carefully note the period of stay they have been granted in E status and apply for an extension of stay before their own validity expires.

CW-1: CNMI-Only Transitional Worker,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/cw-1-cnmi-only-transitional-worker,"
ALERT: USCIS will no longer accept CW-1 petitions filed by employers in the CNMI under the Disaster Recovery Workforce Act on or after Oct. 1, 2022. Starting Oct. 1, construction and extraction occupations are prohibited under the CW-1 program, except for long-term workers. USCIS continues to accept CW-1 petitions other than those seeking approval under the Disaster Recovery Workforce Act. Read more here: USCIS Stops Accepting CW-1 Petitions Under the Disaster Recovery Workforce Act.
The CNMI-Only Transitional Worker (CW-1) visa classification allows employers in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) to apply for permission to employ aliens who are otherwise ineligible to work under other nonimmigrant worker categories. The CW classification provides a method for transition from the former CNMI foreign worker permit system to the U.S. immigration system. For more information about CW status, please see our CW Questions and Answers.
The CW nonimmigrant classification is commonly referred to as:
CW-1: A CNMI-Only transitional worker
CW-2: Dependent of a CNMI-Only transitional worker

To qualify, employers must:
Obtain an approved temporary labor certification (TLC) from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and consider all available U.S. workers for the position;
Be engaged in a legitimate business, including participation in the E-Verify program, as defined at 8 CFR 214.2(w)(1)(vii);
Offer terms and conditions of employment consistent with the nature of the employer’s business in the CNMI;
Comply with all federal and CNMI requirements relating to employment. Examples include: nondiscrimination, occupational safety, and minimum wage requirements;
Pay reasonable transportation costs if the alien is involuntarily dismissed from employment for any reason before the end of the period of authorized admission; and
Comply with the semiannual reporting requirement by timely filing Form I-129CWR, Semiannual Report for CW-1 Employers.

An alien may be classified as a CW-1 nonimmigrant during the transition period, beginning on Nov. 28, 2009 and ending on Dec. 31, 2029, subject to the CW-1 cap, if he or she:
Is ineligible for any other employment-based nonimmigrant status under U.S. immigration law;
Will enter or stay in the CNMI to work in an occupational category designated as needing alien workers to supplement the resident workforce;
Is the beneficiary of a petition filed by a legitimate employer who is doing business in the CNMI;
Is not present in the United States, other than the CNMI;
Is lawfully present in the CNMI if present in the CNMI; and
Is admissible to the United States or is granted any necessary waiver of a ground of inadmissibility.

Generally, an alien classified as a CW-1 nonimmigrant may not be employed in a construction and extraction occupation, unless the alien is a long-term worker who was admitted or otherwise granted status as a CW-1 during each fiscal year from 2015 through 2018 (Oct. 1, 2014 through Sept. 30, 2018).
For complete details, please review the form instructions.
Are petitioning for one or more aliens who are requesting consular processing abroad
You must submit a mandatory “CNMI education funding fee” of $200 per alien, as well as a “fraud prevention and detection fee” of $50 per petition.
If the employer is petitioning for an alien eligible for renewable periods of stay of up to three years, the “CNMI education funding fee” of $200 per alien must also be submitted for each additional year or partial year of requested employment. For example, petitioners requesting CW-1 workers for more than two years, but up to three years, must pay a CNMI education fee of $600 per alien.
If the employer petitioned for the CW-1 worker and the petition has been approved for a validity period of six months or more, the employer must file Form I-129CWR, Semiannual Report for CW-1 Employers, to certify the continued employment and payment of each alien under the terms and conditions of the approved petition. The employer must file Form I-129CWR per approved Form I-129CW, and all aliens included on the approved Form I-129CW must be included on Form I-129CWR, even if they no longer work for the petitioning employer.
If an alien is outside of the CNMI or is approved for consular processing, the alien must apply for admission within 10 days after the beginning of the petition validity period. Otherwise, the petition approval for that alien is subject to revocation on notice.
To obtain CW status the employer must submit the following documentation:
A Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker, with the application fee;
A single, valid temporary labor certification (TLC) approved by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) with evidence showing that each alien meets the minimum job requirements, if any, stated on the TLC. USCIS will reject any CW-1 petition with an employment start date on or after Oct. 1, 2019, filed without the approved DOL TLC;
A mandatory $200 education fee per alien, per year;
A mandatory $50 fraud prevention and detection fee per petition; and
Supporting evidence certifying that the information provided about the alien, the employer, and the job position is accurate and meets eligibility criteria

If the alien is lawfully present in the CNMI with parole authorized by USCIS or CBP, the employer must also include the biometrics fee with the petition if requesting a grant of CW-1 status in the CNMI rather than abroad.
In most situations where a direct grant of status in the CNMI is requested, after the employer files the Form I-129CW, USCIS will contact the employer advising that the alien must go to the USCIS Application Support Center in TSL Plaza in Saipan for the collection of fingerprints and to have a photograph taken. This will enable USCIS to conduct the required security checks.

USCIS will mail an approval notice to the employer if the Form I-129CW is approved. The employer should give the alien a copy of the document. The approval notice will indicate whether the alien has been granted CW-1 status in the CNMI (as evidenced by an attached Form I-94 , Arrival-Departure Record) or whether the alien must proceed to a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad to seek visa processing of the CW-1 visa.

Dependents in the CNMI seeking a grant of CW-2 status may file a Form I-539 concurrently with the employer’s Form I-129CW petition. While dependents may wait until the CW-1 petition is granted, they MUST be lawfully present in the CNMI at the time of filing the Form I-539 in order to be eligible for a grant of CW-2 status in the CNMI. This means dependents may need to file the Form I-539 before the Form I-129CW is granted in order to retain eligibility for CW-2 status. CW-2 status does not authorize employment.
You obtain CW-1 status, either by admission to the CNMI with a CW-1 visa or after receiving an approval notice with attached I-94
Your dependents (spouse and children under the age of 18) are lawfully present in the CNMI
They may file:
Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status;
The filing fee;
The biometric services fee; and
Documentation of your admission to the CNMI in the CW-1 classification.

In general, CW status is valid for up to one year, and may be extended for a maximum total of three years. A CW-1 alien worker, and his or her dependent(s), are admitted for the period of CW-1 petition validity, plus up to 10 days before the validity period begins and 10 days after the validity period ends.
After the second renewal of CW-1 status (in other words, after three consecutive petition validity periods), the alien must depart from the U.S./CNMI for 30 continuous days prior to an employer’s submission of a new CW-1 petition on behalf of the alien.
CW status for an alien who was admitted or otherwise granted status as a CW-1 during each fiscal year from 2015 through 2018 (Oct. 1, 2014 through Sept. 30, 2018) is valid for up to three years. These long-term workers are exempt from the departure requirement.
A dependent’s CW-2 status expires on the same day as the principal alien’s CW-1 status and can be extended when the CW-1 status is extended.
An alien with CW nonimmigrant status will lose that status if he or she violates any of the terms or conditions that are associated with that CW status. However, when the violation is solely caused by termination from employment, the alien will not be considered to have violated his or her status if:
the alien obtains new employment within 30 days from the date of termination; and
an employer files a petition on his or her behalf.

If an alien will change employers, the new employer must file a petition for the alien before the end of this 30-day period in order for the alien to remain lawfully present in the CNMI. The alien may only begin work with the new employer after that employer files the petition.
If a new petition is not filed within 30 days, the alien must leave the CNMI and he or she will be considered to be out of status effective on the date of termination of CW-1 employment. Any petition filed for that alien after the 30-day period will require an approved petition and a CW visa issued at a consulate outside the CNMI before the alien can return to the CNMI and start new employment.
Once the CW petition has been approved, the alien may leave the CNMI but must have the appropriate visa to re-enter the CNMI. The Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, alone is not sufficient for the alien to re-enter the CNMI. Rather, the alien must obtain a CW visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad before returning to the CNMI in order to apply for readmission.
Visa
An alien outside of the CNMI is required to have a visa to apply for admission to the CNMI even if the alien has an approved Form I-129CW petition that confers the CW status.
NOTE: An alien with CW status must have another basis for traveling to any other part of the United States, with certain limited exceptions."

International Entrepreneur Rule,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/international-entrepreneur-rule,"
Alert: Every three years, by regulation, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers will adjust the investment and revenue amounts automatically. We will post the new amounts on our website.
Under the International Entrepreneur Rule (IER), DHS may use its parole authority to grant a period of authorized stay, on a case-by-case basis, to noncitizen entrepreneurs who show that their stay in the United States would provide a significant public benefit through their business venture and that they merit a favorable exercise of discretion.
Under this final rule, entrepreneurs granted parole will be eligible to work only for their startup business. The spouses and children of the noncitizen entrepreneur may also be eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for work authorization once present in the United States as parolees, the children are not eligible to work. We may grant IER parole or up to three entrepreneurs per startup entity.
See below for Frequently Asked Questions. We have also published comprehensive guidance on the International Entrepreneur Rule in our Policy Manual.
Eligibility
Entrepreneurs applying for parole under this rule must show that they: 
Have a substantial ownership interest in a startup entity created in the past five years in the United States that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation;
Have a central and active role in the startup entity such that they are well-positioned to substantially help with the growth and success of the business;
Will provide a significant public benefit to the United States based on their role as an entrepreneur of the startup entity by showing that:
	The startup entity has received a significant investment of capital from certain qualified U.S. investors with established records of successful investments;
The startup entity has received significant awards or grants for economic development, research and development, or job creation (or other types of grants or awards typically given to startup entities) from federal, state, or local government entities that regularly provide such awards or grants to startup entities; or
They partially meet either or both the previous two requirements and provide additional reliable and compelling evidence of the startup entity’s substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation; and

Otherwise merit a favorable exercise of discretion.

A Canadian national traveling directly from Canada to a U.S. port of entry may present an approved Form I-941 at the U.S. port of entry without first obtaining travel documentation.

Filing Form I-131, Application for Travel Document 
The spouse and children (unmarried, minor child under 21 years of age) of an entrepreneur who submits Form I-941 may file Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, with the required application fee and biometrics services fee, to request parole to accompany or join the entrepreneur. They may file the Form I-131 concurrently with the Form I-941 or  separately.
The filing fee for Form I-131 filed by the spouse or child of an entrepreneur is $575. A biometric services fee of $85 is required for applicants 14 through 79 years of age.

Children of entrepreneurs granted parole are not eligible for employment based on this parole.
Questions and Answers: International Entrepreneur Rule
Application requirements and who may apply for parole/re-parole:
ANSWER: Yes. People in the United States in nonimmigrant status can apply under the IER. People who are not presently maintaining nonimmigrant status may also apply for entrepreneur parole but would have to depart the United States to be paroled back in, if authorized, and may have immigration consequences upon departure if they did not maintain their nonimmigrant status.
ANSWER: No. A Form I-941 applicant who has a nonimmigrant status in the United States cannot also be an entrepreneur parolee. If we approve your Form I-941 application and you are in the United States, you may choose to depart the United States and appear at a U.S. port of entry for a final parole determination.
ANSWER: The following documents explain the application process and the requirements for consideration:
Form I-941;
The Instructions for Form I-941;
The International Entrepreneur Rule as published in the Federal Register at 82 FR5238; and
The relevant regulation at 8 CFR section 212.19.

Significant Public Benefit
ANSWER: There is no statutory or regulatory definition of significant public benefit. Specifically, for IER applicants, the threshold criteria described in 8 CFR section 212.19  include some of the factors we consider when determining whether the proposal would provide a significant public benefit to the United States. Parole determinations are case-by-case discretionary determinations that consider the totality of the circumstances of each case. In addition to meeting the investment, grant, or award criteria, you should submit additional supporting evidence describing your startup idea and showing its substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation. Such supporting evidence may include:
Evidence of investments from any investors, government awards or grants, or revenue generation. Such evidence could include bank records, wire transfers, equity purchase agreements, equity certificates, equity ledgers, or capitalization tables.
Letters from relevant government agencies, qualified investors, or established business associations with knowledge of your entity’s research, products, or services. Letters from the same organizations or individuals confirming that your knowledge, skills, or experience would advance your entity’s business.
Newspaper articles or other similar evidence that you or your entity have received significant attention or recognition.
Evidence that you or your entity have been recently invited to participate in, are participating in, or have graduated from one or more established and reputable startup accelerators.
Patent awards or other documents indicating that you or your entity are focused on developing new technologies or innovative research.
Evidence that you have played an active and central role in the success of prior startups, such as letters from relevant government agencies, qualified investors, or established business associations with knowledge of your prior startup activities.
Degrees or other documentation indicating that you have knowledge, skills, or experience that would significantly advance your entity’s business.
Tax or payroll records, Form I-9 records, or other documents indicating that your entity has created qualified jobs before you file for parole.
Any other reliable evidence indicating your entity’s potential for growth and your ability to advance your entity’s business in the United States.

Note: If this list of evidence does not apply to your entrepreneurial activities, you may submit any other evidence that a grant of parole will provide a significant public benefit to the United States based on your role as the entrepreneur of a startup entity.
Startup Entity
ANSWER: You can show substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation by the receipt of significant capital investment from U.S. investors with established records of successful investments in startup entities. You can also show this through significant awards or grants from certain federal, state, or local government entities that regularly provide awards or grants to startup entities. DHS regulations also include alternative criteria for applicants who partially meet the thresholds for capital investment or government awards or grants and can provide additional reliable and compelling evidence of their entities' significant potential for rapid growth and job creation. This additional evidence can include:
The number of users, customers, and revenue generated by the startup entity, and by additional investments or fundraising, including any obtained through crowdfunding platforms;
Social impact of your startup entity;
National scope of your startup entity;
Positive effects on your startup entity’s locality or region;
Your academic degrees;
Your prior success in operating startup entities as shown by patented innovations, annual revenue, job creation, or other factors;
Selection of your startup entity to participate in one or more established and reputable startup accelerators or incubators; and
Any other reliable and compelling evidence that your startup entity has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation.

ANSWER: No. The investment or grants must be made to the qualifying startup entity itself.
Eligibility Requirements for the Entrepreneur
ANSWER: The officers who will process your application are guided by the DHS regulations at 8 CFR section 212.19. We consider ownership interest “substantial” if you (the Form I-941 applicant) have at least a 10% ownership interest in the startup entity at the time of adjudication of the initial grant of parole, and if you have at least a 5% ownership interest in the startup entity at the time of adjudication of a subsequent period of re-parole.
ANSWER: To qualify as an entrepreneur under the IER, you must be well positioned to substantially promote the growth and success of your startup business. You must have the required knowledge, skills, or experience. You should provide a detailed description of your central and active role in the startup entity, along with supporting evidence, which may include:
Letters from relevant government agencies, qualified investors, or established business associations with knowledge of the entity’s research, products or services, and your knowledge, skills or experience that would advance the entity’s business;
Newspaper articles or other similar evidence that you or your entity has received significant attention or recognition;
Evidence that you or your entity has been recently invited to participate in, is currently participating in, or has graduated from one or more established and reputable startup accelerators;
Evidence that you have played an active and central role in the success of prior startup entities;
Degrees or other documentation indicating that you have knowledge, skills or experience that would significantly advance the entity’s business;
Documentation pertaining to intellectual property of the startup entity, such as a patent, that you obtained or that was a result of your efforts and expertise;
Position description of your role in the operations of the company; and
Any other reliable evidence indicating that you perform a central and active role in the startup entity.

Qualified Investment
ANSWER: The startup entity must have received a qualified investment of at least $250,000 (adjusted for inflation—see note below) from one or more qualified investors within 18 months immediately preceding the filing of your Form I-941. DHS regulations also include alternative criteria for applicants who partially meet the thresholds for capital investment or government awards or grants and can provide additional reliable and compelling evidence of their entities' significant potential for rapid growth and job creation.
Note: Every three years, by regulation, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers will adjust the investment amount automatically. The new amount will take effect the following fiscal year. Calculating the adjustment for the three-year period from December 2017 (when we implemented the IER after a federal court vacated the rule delaying the effective date of the final rule) to December 2020, the new amount would be $264,147 as of Oct. 1, 2021. We are publishing the new amounts on our website, as required by regulation, and are working on a technical update to the regulation itself, which will be published in the Federal Register.
Qualified Investor
ANSWER: The regulation defines the term “qualified investor” to include an organization located in the United States and that operates through a legal entity organized under the laws of the United States or any state that is majority owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents (LPRs). While we do not require the applicant to establish that at least 50% of the capital contributed to the fund is sourced from U.S. citizens or LPRs, the applicant must nevertheless show that the firm is majority owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by U.S. citizens or LPRs. The applicant must also establish, among other things, that the investor has a successful track record of accomplishment making investments in startup entities and that the investment is a good faith investment of lawfully derived capital.
ANSWER: The definition of a qualified investor at 8 CFR section 212.19 requires the investor to have a history of substantial investment in successful startup entities. For this requirement, we consider such an individual or organization a qualified investor if, during the preceding five years, the following apply:
The individual or organization made investments in startup entities in exchange for convertible debt or other security convertible into equity commonly used in financing transactions within their respective industries, for a total in such five-year period of no less than $600,000 (adjusted for inflation – see note below); and
After such investment by such individual or organization, at least two such entities each created at least five qualified jobs or generated at least $500,000 (adjusted for inflation—see note below) in revenue with average annualized revenue growth of at least 20%.
Note: Every three years, by regulation, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers will adjust these amounts automatically. The new amount takes effect the following fiscal year. Calculating the adjustment for the three-year period from December 2017 (when USCIS implemented the IER after a federal court vacated the rule delaying the effective date of the final rule) to December 2020, the new amounts will be $528,293 and $633,952 as of Oct. 1, 2021. We are publishing the new amounts on our website, as required by regulation, and are working on a technical update to the regulation itself, which will be published in the Federal Register.

Qualified Government Award or Grant
ANSWER: The startup entity must have received at least $100,000 (adjusted for inflation—see note below) through one or more qualified government awards or grants within 18 months immediately preceding the filing of Form I-941. DHS regulations also include alternative criteria for applicants who partially meet the thresholds for capital investment or government awards or grants and can provide additional reliable and compelling evidence of their entities' significant potential for rapid growth and job creation.
Note: Every three years, by regulation, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers will adjust these amounts automatically. The new amount takes effect the following fiscal year. Calculating the adjustment for the three-year period from December 2017 (when USCIS implemented the IER after a federal court vacated the rule delaying the effective date of the final rule) To December 2020, the new amounts will be $528,293 and $633,952 as of Oct. 1, 2021. We are publishing the new amounts on our website, as required by regulation, and are working on a technical update to the regulation itself, which will be published in the Federal Register.
ANSWER: The government award or grant may be initiated by either the parole applicant or the startup entity. However, the grant must be awarded to the startup entity under regulations outlined at 8 CFR 212. 19.
ANSWER: No. Awards or grants from foreign government entities are not considered qualified government awards or grants under the IER.
Alternative Criteria
ANSWER:  The alternative criteria is discussed in 8 CFR Section 212.19 (b)(2)(iii), Form I-941 instructions, and the preamble to the final rule. Such supporting evidence may include:
Evidence of rapid growth, such as:
	number of users or customers;
revenue generated by the startup entity;
additional investments/fundraising, including crowdfunding platforms;

Social impact of the startup entity;
National scope of the startup entity;
Positive effects on the startup entity’s locality or region; and
Any other reliable and compelling evidence that the startup entity has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation.

number of users or customers;
revenue generated by the startup entity;
additional investments/fundraising, including crowdfunding platforms;

Biometrics
ANSWER: If you are a Form I-941 applicant residing outside the United States and seeking initial parole under the IER, you must submit biometrics. We will send you a notice explaining where to submit biometrics after we coordinate with the Department of State or the International USCIS field office closest to you.
Processes After Conditional Parole is Approved
ANSWER: Filing and obtaining a conditional approval of a Form I-941 application under this rule will not, by itself, constitute a grant of parole. The following processes apply:
If we conditionally approve your Form I-941 application and you are in the United States, you must obtain an I-512L Advance Parole document and depart the United States before appearing at a U.S. port of entry for a final parole determination;
If we conditionally approved your Form I-941 application and you are outside the United States, you must visit a U.S. embassy or consulate to obtain travel documentation (for example, a boarding foil) before appearing at a U.S. port of entry for a final parole determination—unless you are a Canadian national traveling directly from Canada to a U.S. port of entry; and
A Canadian national traveling directly from Canada to a U.S. port of entry may present an approved Form I-941 at the U.S. port of entry without first obtaining travel documentation.

If circumstances do not meaningfully change after USCIS conditionally approves your Form I-941 and DHS does not discover material information that was previously unavailable, CBP is likely to let you parole at a port of entry.
ANSWER: The requirements for the IER are set forth in 8 CFR 212.19 The Department of State does not have different requirements for the program, because DHS makes parole determinations (provisionally by USCIS and finally at the port of entry by CBP; both USCIS and CBP are components of DHS). If you are outside the United States and need to apply to the Department of State for travel documentation, Department of State rules on the process for obtaining travel documentation would apply (if USCIS approves your Form I-941).
However, advance authorization of parole by USCIS does not guarantee that you will be issued travel documentation by the Department of State or paroled by CBP upon your appearance at a port of entry. Rather, with a grant of advance parole, you are issued a document authorizing travel (in lieu of a visa) indicating that, so long as circumstances do not meaningfully change and DHS does not discover material information that was previously unavailable, DHS is likely to let you parole at a port of entry.
ANSWER: A pending or conditionally approved Form I-941 application does not authorize you, if you are present in the United States in nonimmigrant status, to remain in the United States beyond the expiration of your authorized period of stay.
Conditions of Parole
ANSWER: Yes. The maximum initial parole period is two-and-a-half years. Upon re-entry at the U.S. port of entry, you may receive parole for up to the remainder of the two-and-a-half-year initial parole period.
Changing or Adjusting Status or Other Options After Paroling into the United States
ANSWER: You may have an initial parole for up to two-and-a-half years. If approved for re-parole, you may receive up to another two-and-a-half years, for a maximum of five years.
ANSWER: Anytime during the period of parole, you may apply for classification as an immigrant or nonimmigrant, if you are eligible. However, because parole is not admission, you would be ineligible for adjustment or change of status and would have to depart the United States to apply for admission as an immigrant or nonimmigrant, as applicable.
Dependents
ANSWER: Each dependent (your spouse or unmarried children under age 21) seeking parole must independently establish eligibility for parole based on a significant public benefit or an urgent humanitarian reason. Everyone must establish that they merit a favorable exercise of discretion to receive parole. If you have received parole under the IER, we may consider granting parole to your spouse and children if we determine that maintaining your family unity provides a significant public benefit because it further encourages you to operate and grow your business in the United States, and to provide the benefits of such growth to the United States.
ANSWER: Your dependents may file Form I-131 at the same time you file Form I-941, regardless of whether they reside outside of the United States at the time of filing. Your dependents may also file Form I-131 after you file your Form I-941. Any applicants outside the United States will need to continue consular processing with the collection of biometrics, and we will send you a notice explaining where to submit biometrics in coordination with the Department of State or the International USCIS field office closest to you.
ANSWER: Spouses who are paroled into the United States by CBP may immediately apply for work authorization by filing Form I-765. The spouse parolee, however, will not be authorized to work in the United States until the Form I-765 is approved and an employment authorization document is issued.
 Processing times
ANSWER: USCIS has not yet received enough applications to adequately determine typical processing times for Form I-941. You should direct any questions pertaining to consular processing times to Department of State.
Question relating to Form I-941
ANSWER: The prior version of Form I-941 contained a typographical error at Part 5, item 19a. The newest, corrected version of the form  says that the number of qualified jobs required when applying for re-parole is “5.” The correct version of the form is available on the USCIS website (PDF, 766.7 KB)."
Cap Count for H-2B Nonimmigrants,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2b-non-agricultural-workers/cap-count-for-h-2b-nonimmigrants,"
ALERT: The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor issued a temporary final rule that makes available 64,716 additional H-2B temporary nonagricultural worker visas for fiscal year (FY) 2023. These supplemental H-2B visas are for U.S. employers seeking to petition for additional workers at certain periods of the fiscal year. To qualify for the additional visas, petitions must be received at the California Service Center by Sept. 15, 2023. This is the first time the Departments have issued a single rule making available H-2B supplemental visas for several allocations throughout the entire fiscal year, including an allocation for the late second half. More information is available on the Temporary Increase in H-2B Nonimmigrant Visas for FY 2023 page.
The H-2B non-agricultural temporary worker program was created by Congress to allow U.S. employers to bring noncitizens to the United States to fill temporary non-agricultural jobs.
For more information about the H-2B program, see H-2B Non-Agricultural Workers.
Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended, there is a statutory numerical limit, or “cap,” on the total number of noncitizens who may receive an H-2B visa, or otherwise be granted H-2B status, during a fiscal year. Currently, Congress has set the H-2B cap at 66,000 per fiscal year, with 33,000 for workers who begin employment in the first half of the fiscal year (Oct. 1 - March 31) and 33,000 for workers who begin employment in the second half of the fiscal year (April 1 – Sept. 30). Any unused numbers from the first half of the fiscal year will be available for employers seeking to hire H-2B workers during the second half of the fiscal year. Unused H-2B numbers from one fiscal year do not carry over into the next fiscal year.
Anyone (including American workers and H-2B workers who suspect they or others may be the victim of H-2B fraud or abuse) can send us tips, alleged violations, and other relevant information about potential fraud or abuse using our online tip form.
Generally, workers in the United States in H-2B status who extend their stay, change employers, or change the terms and conditions of employment will not be subject to the cap. Similarly, H-2B workers who have previously been counted against the cap in the same fiscal year that the proposed employment begins will not be subject to the cap if the employer names them on the petition and indicates that they have already been counted. The spouse and children of H-2B workers classified as H-4 nonimmigrants also do not count against this cap.
Additionally, petitions for the following types of workers are exempt from the H-2B cap:
Fish roe processors, fish roe technicians, or supervisors of fish roe processing;
Workers performing labor or services in the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands or Guam until Dec. 31, 2029.

Once the H-2B cap is reached, USCIS may only accept petitions for H-2B workers who are exempt or not subject to the H-2B cap.
On Sept. 14, 2022, USCIS announced that it had received a sufficient number of petitions to reach the congressionally mandated H-2B cap for the first half of FY 2023. Sept. 12, 2022, was the “final receipt date” for new cap-subject H-2B worker petitions requesting employment start dates before April 1, 2023. The “final receipt date” is the date on which USCIS determines that it has received enough cap-subject petitions to reach the limit of 33,000 H-2B workers for the first half of FY 2023.
On March 2, 2023, USCIS announced that it had received a sufficient number of petitions to reach the congressionally mandated H-2B cap for the second half of FY 2023. Feb. 27, 2023, was the “final receipt date” for new cap-subject H-2B worker petitions requesting employment start dates before Oct. 1, 2023. The “final receipt date” is the date on which USCIS determines that it has received enough cap-subject petitions to reach the limit of 33,000 H-2B workers for the second half of FY 2023.
Note: The figures above are preliminary estimates and are only meant to give the public an approximate count of beneficiaries of H-2B visas who would be counted towards the INA cap for the fiscal year.
¹ Refers to the total number of beneficiaries of approved or pending petitions filed with USCIS that could potentially be counted towards the H-2B cap. This number will typically exceed the actual cap to allow for withdrawals, denials, and approvals for which no visa is issued.
² If the first half of the fiscal year cap of 33,000 H-2B visas is not reached during the first half of the fiscal year, USCIS will make those unused numbers available for use during the second half of the fiscal year. Unused fiscal year cap-subject H-2B visas do not carry over to the following fiscal year."
Temporary Increase in H-2B Nonimmigrant Visas for FY 2023,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2b-non-agricultural-workers/temporary-increase-in-h-2b-nonimmigrant-visas-for-fy-2023,"
REMINDER: On April 13, 2023, we began accepting petitions for workers for the late second half of FY 2023, requesting employment start dates from May 15, 2023, to Sept. 30, 2023. The 10,000 visas made available under this allocation are limited to returning workers who were issued H-2B visas or held H-2B status in fiscal years 2020, 2021, or 2022, regardless of country of nationality.
Petitions requesting supplemental allocations under this rule must be filed at the California Service Center. Petitions filed under the supplemental allocations in this rule at any location other than the California Service Center will be rejected and the filing fees will be returned.
USCIS is continuing to accept H-2B petitions under the allocation of 20,000 visas set aside for nationals of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Haiti.
ALERT: As of March 30, 2023, USCIS had received enough petitions to reach the additional 16,500 H-2B visas made available for returning workers for the early second half of FY 2023 with start dates from April 1, 2023, to May 14, 2023, under the FY 2023 H-2B supplemental visa temporary final rule.
We have been rejecting and returning any H-2B petitions received after March 30, 2023, that are filed for a returning worker under the early second half of FY 2023 allocation., together with any accompanying fees. Read more:  Cap Reached for Additional Returning Worker H-2B Visas for the Early Second Half of FY 2023. 
On Dec. 15, 2022, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) jointly published a temporary final rule increasing the numerical limit (or cap) on H-2B nonimmigrant visas by up to 64,716 additional visas for all of (FY) 2023.
These supplemental visas are available only to U.S. businesses that are suffering irreparable harm or will suffer impending irreparable harm without the ability to employ all the H-2B workers requested in their petition, as attested by the employer on a new attestation form.
In contrast to previously issued H-2B supplemental visa rules, this rule authorizes H-2B supplemental visas for all of FY 2023. To assist U.S. businesses that need workers to begin work on different start dates, the supplemental visas will be distributed in several allocations, including two separate allocations for the second half of FY 2023. See “Allocation of Supplemental Visas” below.
Of the 64,716 additional visas, 44,716 are available only for returning workers (workers who received an H-2B visa or were otherwise granted H-2B status in one of the last three fiscal years). The remaining 20,000 visas are set aside for nationals of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras (collectively called Northern Central American countries) and Haiti, who are exempt from the returning worker requirement. See “Who Can Petition for the Additional Visas” below. To qualify for the additional 64,716 visas, petitions must be received at the California Service Center by Sept. 15, 2023.
This increase is based on time-limited statutory authority that does not affect the H-2B program in future fiscal years.
This increase in the cap is in accordance with Section 101(6) of Division A of Public Law 117-180, Continuing Appropriations and Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2023, which extended the authorization previously provided in Section 204 of Division O of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, which gave the secretary of DHS the authority to make available additional H-2B visas for FY 2023. Before authorizing the additional visa numbers, the secretary of homeland security, in consultation with the secretary of labor, considered the needs of businesses and other factors, including the impact on U.S. workers and the integrity of the H-2B program.
Who Can Petition for the Additional H-2B Visas
Only U.S. businesses that are suffering irreparable harm or will suffer impending irreparable harm (permanent and severe financial loss) if they cannot employ all the H-2B workers that they request on their Form I-129 petition may file H-2B petitions under this temporary increase. In addition, employers may only request workers who have been issued an H-2B visa or otherwise granted H-2B status in FY 2020, 2021, or 2022, unless they are petitioning for workers under the 20,000 Northern Central American/Haiti allotment.
The joint temporary final rule provisions pertaining to the 64,716 supplemental visas do not apply to petitions that are not subject to the H-2B cap, including those petitions filed for an H-2B extension of stay request or on behalf of certain fish roe processors. Those petitions may continue to be filed under the normal rules of the H-2B program.
The 64,716 visas are divided into the following allocations:
For the first half of FY 2023 (Oct. 1, 2022 – March 31, 2023): 18,216 visas limited to returning workers who were issued H-2B visas or held H-2B status in fiscal years 2020, 2021, or 2022, regardless of country of nationality. These petitions must have requested employment start dates on or before March 31, 2023.  On January 31, 2023, USCIS announced that it had received enough petitions to reach the cap for this allocation;
For the early second half of FY 2023 (April 1 to May 14): 16,500 visas limited to returning workers who were issued H-2B visas or held H-2B status in fiscal years 2020, 2021, or 2022, regardless of country of nationality. These early second half of FY 2023 petitions must have requested employment start dates from April 1, 2023, to May 14, 2023. Furthermore, employers must have filed these petitions no earlier than March 14, 2023. On March 31, 2023, USCIS announced that it had received enough petitions to reach the cap for this allocation;
For the late second half of FY 2023 (May 15 to Sept. 30): 10,000 visas limited to returning workers who were issued H-2B visas or held H-2B status in fiscal years 2020, 2021, or 2022, regardless of country of nationality. These late second half of FY 2023 petitions must request employment start dates from May 15, 2023, to Sept. 30, 2023. Furthermore, employers must file these petitions no earlier than April 13, 2023; and
For employers seeking nationals of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Haiti: There are 20,000 visas reserved for the entirety of FY 2023. Employers requesting an employment start date in the first half of FY 2023 (on or before March 31, 2023) may file such petitions immediately on or after Dec. 15, 2022. Employers requesting an employment start date in the second half of FY 2023 (on or after April 1, 2023) must file such petitions no earlier than March 14, 2023.

Dec. 15, 2022.
March 14, 2023
As of March 30, 2023, USCIS has received enough petitions to reach the cap for this allocation.
For start dates on or before March 31, 2023: Dec. 15, 2022
For start dates on or after April 1, 2023: March 14, 2023
Cap Count - Northern Central American/Haitian Allocation
There are 20,000 H-2B visas (from the 64,716 supplemental cap visas) that are reserved for FY 2023 for nationals of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Haiti, who are exempt from the returning worker requirement. Employers requesting an employment start date for such nationals in the first half of FY 2023 (on or before March 31, 2023) may file petitions on or after Dec. 15, 2022. Employers requesting an employment start date for such nationals in the second half of FY 2023 (on or after April 1, 2023) must file such petitions no earlier than 15 days after the second half statutory cap is reached. The statutory cap for the second half of FY2023 was reached on Feb. 27, 2023, therefore such petitions must have been filed no earlier than March 14, 2023.
As of July 20, 2023, the Northern Central American /Haitian allocation for the FY 2023 supplemental cap remains open.
How to File an H-2B Petition for the Additional H-2B Visas
To assist U.S. businesses that need workers to begin work on different start dates, the supplemental visas will be distributed in several allocations, including two separate allocations for the second half of FY 2023. The “Allocation of Supplemental Visas” section above explains when employers can submit their petitions. All petitions requesting the additional H-2B visas made available for FY 2023 must be filed at the California Service Center.
To qualify for H-2B supplemental cap visas, petitioners must:
Meet all existing H-2B eligibility requirements (including obtaining an approved temporary labor certification (TLC) from DOL that is valid for the entire employment period stated on the petition). As a reminder, the employment start date on the petition must match the employment start date on the TLC, even if that date has passed;
If applicable, refresh recruitment for U.S. workers, as described in the temporary final rule (if Form I-129 is filed 30 or more days after the certified start date of work on the TLC);
Submit an attestation on the DOL Form ETA 9142-B-CAA-7  (PDF) in which the petitioner affirms, under penalty of perjury, that its business is suffering irreparable harm or will suffer impending irreparable harm if it cannot employ the requested H-2B workers, and that it is seeking to employ returning workers only, unless the worker is eligible under the Northern Central American/Haiti allotment. Please follow the DOL Form ETA 9142-B-CAA-7  (PDF) Instructions when completing the attestation; and
Agree to comply with all applicable labor and employment laws, including health and safety laws pertaining to COVID-19, as well as any rights to time off or paid time off to obtain COVID-19 vaccinations, or to reimbursement for travel to and from the nearest available vaccination site, and notify the workers in a language understood by the worker as necessary or reasonable, of equal access of nonimmigrants to COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination distribution sites.

NOTE: USCIS will not accept the expired ETA 9142-B-CAA from FY 2017, ETA 9142-B-CAA-2 from FY 2018, ETA 9142-B-CAA-3 from FY 2019, ETA 9142-B-CAA-4 from FY 2021, ETA-9142-B-CAA-5 from the first half of FY 2022, or ETA-9142-B-CAA-6 from the second half of FY 2022. We will reject any petition that does not include the new ETA 9142-B-CAA-7  (PDF) attestation form for FY 2023 (or a copy of this new form) but is seeking H-2B workers under this FY 2023 supplemental allocation.
Petitioners must retain evidence and records proving compliance with the rule and demonstrating that their business is suffering irreparable harm or will suffer impending irreparable harm if they are unable to employ all the H-2B workers requested in their petition. Additionally, petitioners must attest that they have prepared and retained a detailed written statement describing how the evidence demonstrates irreparable harm or would demonstrate irreparable harm for those instances involving impending irreparable harm. The retention requirements under the rule require petitioners to retain evidence for a period of three years that the employer requested and/or instructed that each of the H-2B workers petitioned under this rule were issued H-2B visas or otherwise granted H-2B status in FY 2020, 2021, or 2022 unless the petition requests H-2B workers under the Northern Central American/Haiti allotment, who are not subject to a returning worker requirement. Petitioners must provide the documentation if DHS or DOL request it, as well as fully cooperate with any compliance reviews such as audits. Both DHS and DOL intend to conduct a significant number of post-adjudication audits to ascertain compliance with the attestation requirements as well as key worker protection provisions implemented through this temporary final rule.
DHS will also subject employers that have committed certain labor law violations in the H-2B program to additional scrutiny in the supplemental cap petition process. These measures are aimed at ensuring compliance with H-2B program requirements and obligations.
Important Filing Information
USCIS is implementing a change in the filing location for petitions filed under the supplemental allocations in this rule, with all such filings at the California Service Center. Under standard processes, H-2B petitions are filed at one of two USCIS service centers generally based on the state in which the petitioner’s primary office is located. To manage the additional workload from the supplemental allocations provided by this rule, all such filings will be centralized at the California Service Center. Petitions filed under the supplemental allocations in this rule at any location other than the California Service Center will be rejected and the filing fees will be returned.
For petitions requesting returning workers, or workers from Haiti, El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras, with a start date in the first half of the fiscal year, USCIS will not accept any requests for premium processing until Jan. 3, 2023. USCIS will reject the I-907 and return the premium processing filing fee, if the I-907 was received before Jan. 3, 2023.
Generally, the employment start date listed on an H-2B petition must be the same as the employment start date authorized on the TLC. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(iv)(D). Petitions with employment start dates that do NOT match the TLC’s employment start date will be rejected and returned with fees. However, for purposes of this H-2B cap increase, petitioners may use TLCs that list an employment start date that has passed if the TLC is otherwise valid. USCIS may deny or reject a petition submitted without the required attestation.
H-2B petitions filed for the supplemental visa allocation may generally request unnamed workers, but such workers will be subject to the returning worker requirement or the limitation to nationals of Northern Central American countries and Haiti.
A petition may be filed with only a single Form ETA 9142-B-CAA-7  (PDF). A petitioner requesting both returning workers and Northern Central American/Haitian nationals who are exempt from the returning worker requirement must do so on separate petitions.
On the Form ETA 9142-B-CAA-7  (PDF), the petitioner must indicate the supplemental visa allocation under which H-2B nonimmigrant workers are requested. A petitioner must only indicate a single allocation and must only request workers who qualify for this allocation. If more than one box is checked or the petition is requesting workers who do not qualify for the requested allocation, USCIS may reject, or deny, or take other adverse action with respect to the petition.
If a petitioner files a petition seeking H-2B workers under this supplemental visa allocation and requests a change of status for a worker in the U.S., USCIS will deny the change of status request but will adjudicate the petition to determine eligibility for H-2B classification.
If USCIS approves the H-2B petition, the worker would need to obtain the H-2B visa, if applicable, at a consular post abroad before seeking admission to the U.S. in H-2B status at a port of entry. Check the Department of State processing times webpage to ensure that workers have sufficient time to apply for a visa.
Filing Deadline
USCIS will stop accepting petitions under this temporary final rule received after Sept. 15, 2023, or after the applicable cap has been reached, whichever occurs first. We will reject any petitions received after Sept. 15 or after the cap is reached, whichever is earlier. USCIS will deny all pending petitions not approved before Oct. 1, 2023, and will not refund any fees.
We will consider petitions requesting an employment start date after Sept. 30, 2023, towards the first half statutory FY 2024 H-2B cap, subject to all eligibility requirements for FY 2024 H-2B cap filings.
Portability
In addition to making additional visas available under the FY 2023 time-limited authority, DHS is exercising its general H-2B regulatory authority to temporarily extend portability flexibility that allows certain H-2B workers who are already in the United States to begin work with a new employer after USCIS receives the H-2B petition (supported by a valid temporary labor certification) filed on their behalf, and before the H-2B petition is approved. Portability enables certain H-2B workers to change employers more quickly if they encounter unsafe or abusive working conditions. With disruptions and uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, including possible future impacts of COVID-19 variants, this additional flexibility allows U.S. employers to meet their labor needs, while allowing H-2B workers to change employers more quickly. This effective extension of a current and temporary flexibility is available if a nonfrivolous H-2B petition requesting an extension of stay is received on or after Jan. 25, 2023, but no later than 1 year after that date.
Petitions filed to extend the stay of H-2B workers who are already in the U.S. as H-2B workers are not subject to the cap. Thus, petitioners requesting to have these current H-2B workers immediately work for them after they file their petition with USCIS and before the petition is approved, under the portability provision of the temporary final rule, are not subject to the irreparable harm requirement. These petitioners, who are only seeking portability flexibilities for cap-exempt workers, are also not required to conduct a fresh round of recruitment or to submit Form ETA 9142-B-CAA-7  (PDF). Eligibility for this portability provision does not require the petitioner to file at the California Service Center.
Reporting Fraud
To report that a participating employer may be abusing the H-2B program, please email us at ReportH2BAbuse@uscis.dhs.gov. Your email should include information identifying the H-2B petitioning employer and relevant information that leads you to believe that the H-2B petitioning employer is abusing the H-2B program."

Update to Visa Availability Approach for Form I-526,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-fifth-preference-eb-5/update-to-visa-availability-approach-for-form-i-526,"
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is announcing an update to the visa availability approach to managing the inventory of Form I-526, Immigrant Petition by Alien Investor. The visa availability approach applies to pre-EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 Form I-526 petitions and prioritizes the assignment of such petitions for investors with an available visa or a visa that will be available soon. The USCIS Immigrant Investor Program Office (IPO) manages this Form I-526 petition inventory through workflow queues factoring in whether: a visa is available (or will be available soon) and the underlying project has been reviewed. Workflow queues are generally managed in first-in, first-out (FIFO) order when a visa is available or will be available soon. Effective July 2023, IPO will update this approach by grouping petitions by new commercial enterprise (NCE) with filing dates on or before Nov. 30, 2019, within the workflow queue of petitions where the project has been reviewed and there is a visa available or soon to be available, to gain greater processing efficiencies.
Purpose
The purpose of updating the visa availability approach is to enable USCIS to increase productivity and more efficiently process Form I-526 petitions. As described in more detail below, IPO will group petitions in the third queue by NCE with filing dates on or before Nov. 30, 2019, because adjudicators can process Form I-526 petitions more efficiently when they are working multiple petitions associated with the same NCE given the overlap in project documents and issues presented.
Updated Process Description and Rationale
Under the visa availability inventory management approach, IPO determines visa availability and queues up the Form I-526 inventory into three workflows on a monthly basis as discussed here (PDF, 238.48 KB).
The first queue contains Form I-526 petitions where a visa is not yet available and not soon to be available and is ordered first-in, first-out.
The second queue contains petitions related to projects that IPO has not previously reviewed and have a visa immediately available or soon to be available. IPO reviews projects in the second queue in order from oldest to newest.
The third queue contains Form I-526 petitions that have an available (or soon to be available) visa and either a reviewed project or “non-pooled” (single investor) standalone project. This queue is organized by receipt date of the Form I-526 petition (from oldest to newest). This is the queue from which Form I-526 petitions are assigned to officers for adjudication. Form I-526 petitions have generally been assigned to officers in first-in, first-out order.

The update to the visa availability approach is effective July 18, 2023. IPO will group petitions by NCE with filing dates on or before Nov. 30, 2019, within the third queue. These petitions will be assigned by NCE using a FIFO methodology, namely, by date of the earliest filed petition in that queue for each NCE. Given the large volume of petitions filed shortly before the EB-5 modernization rule had taken effect in November 2019 and because the project documents are often the same, assigning multiple petitions associated with the same NCE to the same adjudicator(s) will enable IPO to gain greater processing efficiencies, reduce the backlog and Form I-526 completion times, and support consistency and accuracy in adjudications, while maintaining fairness given the closeness in the filing dates of these petitions.
USCIS is committed to reducing its Form I-526 petition backlog and completion times and has determined that this update to the visa availability approach will help the agency achieve this goal.

Questions and Answers: EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program Visa Availability Approach,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-fifth-preference-eb-5/questions-and-answers-eb-5-immigrant-investor-program-visa-availability-approach,"
Questions and Answers: Visa Availability Approach to Prioritizing Immigrant Petitions by Alien Investor (Form I-526).  
---------------
A1. Instead of taking a first-in, first-out (FIFO) approach to processing pending I-526 petitions, as of March 31, 2020, USCIS began first processing petitions for investors for whom a visa is either now or soon will be available. Form I-526 captures a petitioner’s country of birth, which is compared with Chart B of the Department of State Monthly Visa Bulletin, indicating visa availability for that country. USCIS uses this information, along with other factors, to determine which Form I-526 petitions should be processed first. Petitioners can check when to expect processing of their Form I-526 petition on the USCIS Processing Times page. 

A2. The significance of this processing change is that, effective March 31, 2020, rather than taking a first-in, first-out approach for adjudications of pending I-526 petitions, USCIS began first processing petitions for investors for whom a visa is either now or will soon be available. Under a FIFO process, generally USCIS processes Form I-526 petitions in the order received. Under the FIFO process, consequently, petitioners without visa numbers available would tend to be processed ahead of those with visa numbers available, given that the oldest Form I-526 petitions were primarily from countries that were oversubscribed. (“Oversubscribed” means that a country’s visa demand exceeds the supply of visa numbers available for allocation in a given classification from the U.S. Department of State).

A3.  USCIS applied the visa availability approach to all pending Form I-526 petitions as of March 31, 2020. At the same time, USCIS continued to work on Form I-526 petitions assigned for adjudication before March 31, 2020.

A4. This change in Form I-526 prioritization aligns EB-5 processing with certain other USCIS operations and programs that involve numerical caps for visa availability (for example, preference category family visa petitions). This change  aligns better with congressional intent for visa allocation  and increases fairness in the administration of the EB-5 immigrant investor program.

A5. The USCIS Immigrant Investor Program Office (IPO) assesses visa availability monthly by reviewing the Department of State Monthly Visa Bulletin.

A6. The USCIS Office of Performance and Quality reports processing times online and makes every effort to update the processing times every month. 

A7. USCIS implemented the visa availability approach on March 31, 2020. USCIS is unable to speculate on future changes.

A8. USCIS will review the expedite request in line with the agency’s standard guidelines. An approved expedite means that USCIS will expedite processing by taking the application or petition out of order. Once USCIS has assigned the petition to an officer, the timeline for reaching an adjudicative decision will vary.

A9. USCIS created standard language for responses to such inquiries, which inform the petitioner that the case remains pending and direct the petitioner to the USCIS processing time page.

A10. USCIS has considered potential adverse impacts and reliance interests, such as delays for those with already pending petitions from oversubscribed countries. USCIS sees many benefits to changing to a visa availability approach, specifically for petitioners from countries where visas are immediately available, because these petitioners would be better positioned to use their annual per-country allocation of EB-5 visas. Additionally, this change increases parity with other agency practices, aligns with congressional intent, and provides immediate relief for certain petitioners from underrepresented countries currently subject to significant wait times due to the current process. Moreover, this change does not create legally binding rights or penalties and does not change eligibility requirements.

A11. If the investor would be eligible to charge his or her immigrant visa to a country other than the investor’s country of birth, the investor should email IPO at uscis.immigrantinvestorprogram@uscis.dhs.gov and identify the foreign state of cross-chargeability and the basis of cross-chargeability (for example, his or her spouse’s country of birth). If the investor provides sufficient information or documentation, IPO will consider visa availability associated with the foreign state of cross-chargeability when determining whether to assign the Form I-526 petition for adjudication.

A12. At the beginning of FY 2021, IPO had about 236 dedicated personnel, including support staff, adjudicators, economists, Fraud Detection and National Security personnel, and other positions vital to the IPO mission. The number of adjudicative resources and personnel assigned to each EB-5 form type varies according to workload demands and agency priorities.

A13. The visa availability approach to managing inventory applies to pre-EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act Form I-526 petitions. IPO manages this Form I-526 petition inventory through workflows factoring in whether:
	A visa is available (or will be available soon); and
The underlying project has been reviewed.


A visa is available (or will be available soon); and
The underlying project has been reviewed.

Workflows are generally managed in FIFO order when a visa is available or will be available soon. Please see this description (PDF, 238.48 KB) for more information.
Additionally, effective July 18, 2023, IPO will group petitions by new commercial enterprise (NCE) with filing dates on or before Nov. 30, 2019, within the workflow of petitions where the project has been reviewed and there is a visa available or soon to be available. These petitions will be assigned by NCE using a FIFO methodology, namely, by date of the earliest filed petition in that workflow for each NCE. Given the large volume of petitions filed shortly before the EB-5 modernization rule had taken effect in November 2019 and because the project documents are often the same, assigning multiple petitions associated with the same NCE to the same adjudicator(s) will enable IPO to gain greater processing efficiencies, reduce the backlog and Form I-526 completion times, maximize visa usage, and support consistency and accuracy in adjudications, while maintaining fairness given the closeness in the filing dates of these petitions.

Questions and Answers: EB-5 Further Deployment,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-fifth-preference-eb-5/questions-and-answers-eb-5-further-deployment,"
A1. For now, Form I-924A does not separately require information about specific further deployment activity. However, we routinely revise forms and a future version of Form I-924A may require such information

A2. We must be able to determine whether you have met all applicable requirements, including that your capital is at risk and that your new commercial enterprise continues to engage in lawful commercial activity throughout the entire EB-5 adjudication process (from the time we receive your petition through the time of its adjudication). Depending on your case, you may need to give us more information so that we can determine whether you are eligible for the benefit. You may submit this information to us while your petition is pending (this is called interfiling). We may also notify you and request additional information during the adjudication process.

A3. Yes, you may, if we approve the request to expand the geographic area before you further deploy your capital. Per our guidance on further deployment (PDF, 314.97 KB), after investors meet the job creation requirement, “further deployment must occur within the regional center’s geographic area, including any amendments to its geographic area approved before the further deployment.” A regional center must submit a request via Form I-924 to amend its geographic area. We must approve the Form I-924 and the expanded designated geographic area before you can further deploy your capital into the expanded geographic area.

A4. Yes, because the July 24, 2020, Policy Manual update clarifies existing policy, we will apply it to all Forms I-526 and I-829 pending at the time of publication as well as future petitions. We determined that any potential impacts to investors are minimal because the updated guidance merely clarifies continuing eligibility requirements. This clarification does not change any substantive requirements.

A5. After we approve an investor’s Form I-526, and before the investor obtains conditional permanent resident status, we may revoke the approval based on our discretionary revocation authority. (See INA §205.) We do not, however, currently have a routine process to seek information about further deployment during that period. To the extent that we become aware of such information, we will seek to exercise our discretionary authority judiciously on a case-by-case basis, taking into account any derogatory information, fraud or willful misrepresentation, or other evidence of bad faith.

A6. While the clarifying guidance only updates the Policy Manual at Volume 6, Part G, Chapters 2 and 4, many of the same concepts apply to the related requirements for removal of conditions in Form I-829 adjudications (for example, what constitutes a qualifying at-risk investment in an ongoing commercial enterprise). However, the impact and timing of certain changes related to further deployment may differ between Form I-526 and Form I-829 adjudications. As explained in the Policy Manual at Volume 6, Part G, Chapter 5, relating to Form I-829 adjudication, USCIS permits an immigrant investor who has been admitted to the United States on a conditional basis to remove those conditions even if certain circumstances have changed.
	Accordingly, when we review further deployment while adjudicating Form I-829, we focus on whether the investor can establish that the further deployment complies with applicable requirements, including sustaining their at-risk capital investment in an ongoing commercial enterprise (that is, having a sufficient relationship to commercial activity) over the required period of time, despite certain changed circumstances related to the further deployment. Notably, the law does not necessarily require further deployment within an approved regional center to remove conditions once an investor has obtained conditional permanent resident status. As noted in the Policy Manual, even termination of the regional center the investor is associated with will not automatically terminate the investor’s conditional resident status. The investor will continue to have the opportunity to demonstrate compliance with EB-5 program requirements, including through reliance on indirect job creation.

A7. As explained in the Policy Manual at Volume 6, Part G, Chapter 5, in cases where the investment did not create the required number of jobs in accordance with the original business plan, further deployment may be possible during the conditional residency period, provided the petitioner filed the initial Form I-526 immigrant petition in good faith and with full intention to follow the plan outlined in that petition.
	However, if an investor has not yet obtained conditional permanent resident status, the material change guidance discussed in the Policy Manual, Volume 6, Part G, Chapter 4, applies.

A8. Yes. The clarifying Policy Manual guidance at Volume 6, Part G, Chapter 2, provides that an investor may deploy capital directly or indirectly through any financial instrument, so long as it meets applicable requirements. Deployments of capital, both initial and further deployments, must satisfy applicable requirements to:
	Place the capital at risk, to include a risk of loss and a chance for gain;
Demonstrate the actual undertaking of business activity;
Demonstrate a sufficient relationship to commercial activity such that the enterprise is and remains commercial; and
Make the full amount of the investment available to the business(es) most closely responsible for creating employment.


Place the capital at risk, to include a risk of loss and a chance for gain;
Demonstrate the actual undertaking of business activity;
Demonstrate a sufficient relationship to commercial activity such that the enterprise is and remains commercial; and
Make the full amount of the investment available to the business(es) most closely responsible for creating employment.

However, for further deployments of capital after satisfying the job creation requirement, the initial deployment of capital that satisfied the job creation requirement generally will have also met the requirement that the full investment amount be made available to the business(es) most closely responsible for creating employment.
A9. Yes. New issue municipal bonds are a type of financial instrument included within the clarified Policy Manual guidance, which (in Volume 6, Part G, Chapter 2) provides that capital may be deployed directly or through any financial instrument so long as it meets applicable requirements.

EB-5 Questions and Answers: EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 (updated April 2022),https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-fifth-preference-eb-5/eb-5-questions-and-answers-eb-5-reform-and-integrity-act-of-2022-updated-april-2022,"
Entities seeking to be designated as a regional center are required to file Form I-956, Application for Regional Center Designation. USCIS will be publishing this new form, including the form instructions, with additional information regarding the filing process by May 14, 2022.
Pooled standalone cases are not allowed under the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022; therefore, USCIS will reject any petition based on a pooled, non-regional center investment filed on or after March 15, 2022. USCIS will adjudicate pooled standalone cases filed before March 15, 2022 based on eligibility requirements at the time such petitions were filed.
USCIS will review the area claimed as a high unemployment area when adjudicating the project application for regional center filings or the individual’s petition for standalone investments.
A high unemployment area is a census tract, or contiguous census tracts, where the new commercial enterprise is principally doing business, experiencing unemployment of at least 150% the national average. When calculating the weighted unemployment rate, the area may include any census tracts directly adjacent to those where the NCE is principally doing business.
USCIS will determine if the investment is in a qualified infrastructure project when adjudicating the regional center’s project application.
An infrastructure project is a capital investment project in a filed or approved business plan, which is administered by a governmental entity (such as a federal, state, or local agency or authority) that is the job-creating entity contracting with a regional center or new commercial enterprise to receive capital investment under the Regional Center Program from alien investors or the new commercial enterprise as financing for maintaining, improving, or constructing a public works project.
The EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 allows for further deployment of capital anywhere in the United States or its territories. Therefore, including for petitions filed pre-enactment, further deployment is not required within the same regional center or within any regional center's geographic area.

ALERT: In January 2023, USCIS extended the validity of Permanent Resident Cards (also known as Green Cards) for petitioners who properly file Form I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence, or Form I-829, Petition by Investor to Remove Conditions on Permanent Resident Status for 48 months beyond the card’s expiration date. Read more here: USCIS Extends Green Card Validity for Conditional Permanent Residents with a Pending Form I-751 or Form I-829.
ALERT: Dec. 29, 2022, is no longer the deadline to file Form I-956, Application for Regional Center Designation, amendments, as required by the Behring Settlement, and Form I-956G, Regional Center Annual Statement. USCIS is extending this deadline until we publish guidance that clarifies the requirements of these forms.
ALERT: The EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 requires USCIS to establish a special fund known as the EB-5 Integrity Fund, which USCIS will use primarily in administering the Regional Center Program. USCIS must collect a $20,000 or $10,000 fee, as directed by the new law, for the EB-5 Integrity Fund from each designated regional center. USCIS is drafting and will soon publish a Federal Register notice to explain when and how the fee will need to be paid. USCIS will announce on uscis.gov when the Federal Register notice has been published.
ALERT: Beginning Sept. 1, 2022, we will no longer accept a single, combined fee payment when an applicant or petitioner files Form I-526, Immigrant Petition by Standalone Investor, or Form I-526E, Immigrant Petition by Regional Center Investor, together with Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, Form 131, Application for Travel Document, or Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. Petitioners may combine the fee payment for Forms I-485, I-131 and I-765. However, petitioners must send a separate fee payment for Form I-526 or Form I-526E.
If a petitioner or applicant submits a single, combined fee payment for Forms I-526 or I-526E and the other forms, we will reject the forms for improper fee payment and return the fee.
Alert: On June 24, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in Behring Regional Center LLC v. Mayorkas, et al, 3:22-cv-02487, issued a preliminary injunction enjoining USCIS “from treating as deauthorized the previously designated regional centers.” Previously designated regional centers are now able to file Form I-956F, Application for Approval of an Investment in a Commercial Enterprise. USCIS is complying with the court’s order.

USCIS Clarifies Guidance on Initial and Further Deployment of Investment Capital
July 24, 2020 
USCIS has updated the USCIS Policy Manual with clarifying guidance on the deployment of investment capital under the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program."
EB-5 Regional Center Compliance Reviews,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-fifth-preference-eb-5/eb-5-immigrant-investor-regional-centers/eb-5-regional-center-compliance-reviews,"
This page in Simplified Chinese.  (PDF, 95.33 KB)
Regional center compliance reviews are another way to enhance EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program integrity and verify information in regional center applications and annual certifications. Under this program, USCIS will collect case-specific data as part of a compliance review.
A compliance review verifies the information that designated regional centers provide in applications and annual certifications. It also verifies compliance with applicable laws and authorities to ensure continued eligibility for the regional center designation. This process includes, for example, researching information in government systems, reviewing commercial and public records, and reviewing evidence that accompanies regional center applications and certifications. It also includes obtaining information, on a consensual basis, through compliance review data requests and site assessments.
The review team will perform such tasks as:
Reviewing applications, certifications, and associated records;
Reviewing public records and information on the regional center;
Verifying the information, including supporting documentation, submitted with the application(s) and in the annual certification(s);
Conducting site assessments;
Assessing the effectiveness of internal controls related to the regional center’s administration, oversight, and management functions;
Reviewing and analyzing financial documentation;
Interviewing personnel to confirm the validity of the information provided with the application(s) and annual certification(s).

Before the site assessment, regional centers should be prepared to present any information originally submitted with the application(s) or certification(s), any updates to that information, and any information requested in the data request that has not previously been provided. The review team may also request additional support to verify information provided in the application(s) or certification(s).
During the site assessment, regional centers should immediately provide any readily available documentation and information that the review team requests to verify information provided in the application(s) or certification(s).
After the site assessment, regional centers should provide all additional information requested to verify or update information in any follow-up communication from USCIS.
The review team will document the results in a compliance report, which becomes part of the regional center’s record. Information obtained through the compliance review will be used to assess the regional center’s adherence to applicable laws and authorities. If the report contains any indicators of fraud, USCIS will assess whether further investigation is warranted.
Please note regional centers must continue to serve the purpose of promoting economic growth to remain eligible for designation. At any point, if the regional center principal expresses an unwillingness to participate in the site assessment, the visit will be cancelled. The review team will complete the compliance report using the data available and indicate that the site assessment was cancelled at the request of the regional center. As stated in the Form I-924 and Form I-924A instructions, to ensure compliance with applicable laws and authorities, USCIS may verify information submitted in accordance with those forms."
