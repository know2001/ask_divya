      "['\\nMany noncitizens want to come to the United States to work. This page provides a summary of employment-based nonimmigrant and immigrant visa classifications and other categories of noncitizens who are eligible for employment authorization. Each classification provides a link to more detailed information on its requirements.\\nA common way to work temporarily in the United States as a nonimmigrant is for a prospective employer to file a petition with USCIS on your behalf. The Temporary (Nonimmigrant) Workers webpage describes the main nonimmigrant temporary worker classifications.\\nIf you have the right combination of skills, education, and/or work experience, you may be able to live and work permanently in the United States by seeking an employment-based immigrant visa. The Permanent Workers webpage describes the five employment-based immigrant visa preferences (also called categories).\\nIf you live outside the United States and want to work here, you generally must apply for a visa from the U.S. Department of State (DOS), unless a visa is not required for people from your country of nationality. You may visit DOS’ Travel Without a Visa page for more information.\\nIn many cases, USCIS must approve your petition before you are eligible to apply to DOS for a visa or seek admission at a port of entry. Before entering the United States, you must present yourself to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer and receive permission to enter the United States and engage in your proposed activity.\\nIf you are in the United States in a lawful nonimmigrant status that does not provide employment authorization, you generally may apply for:\\nA change of status to a nonimmigrant classification that provides employment authorization; or\\nAn adjustment of status to become a lawful permanent resident. This may be a concurrent filing with an immigrant visa petition or, depending on the circumstances, may require an applicant to obtain an approved immigrant visa before applying for an adjustment of status to become a lawful permanent resident.\\n\\nDepending on the classification you seek, your change or adjustment of status application might require a U.S. employer or other qualified requestor to file an application or petition on your behalf to establish your eligibility before we approve your application. However, if you apply based on certain classifications (for example, an alien with extraordinary ability or as a nonimmigrant E-1 or E-2 principal treaty trader or investor), you may be eligible to self-petition, which means filing an application on your own behalf.\\nAdditionally, if you are in the United States, including if you are an applicant for permanent residence or a certain family member of an alien who has lawful nonimmigrant status, you may file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, to request employment authorization and an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). You may also apply for an EAD that shows such authorization if your immigration status authorizes you to work in the United States without restrictions.\\nThe conditions you must meet and how long you can work in the United States depend on the type of immigration status the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grants. You must comply with all conditions of your employment authorization and the terms of your admission to this country. If you violate any of the conditions, you could be removed from or denied re-entry into the United States.', '\\nIf you would like to come to the United States to work permanently or temporarily, your employer or potential employer will need to file a petition on your behalf.\\nReview the information below to determine which petition should be filed on your behalf.\\nBelow is the list of Form-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker, categories:\\nE-1 Treaty Trader\\nE-2 Treaty Investor\\nE-3 Treaty Trader (Free Trade Professionals from Australia)\\nH-1B Nonimmigrant in a Specialty Occupation\\nH-1B1 Singapore and Chile Nationals in a Specialty Occupation\\nH-1B2 Department of Defense Worker\\nH-1B3 Fashion Model\\nH-1C Registered Nurses\\nH-2A Seasonal Agricultural Worker\\nH-2B Seasonal Non-Agricultural Worker\\nH-3 Nonimmigrant Trainee\\nI Representative of Foreign Information Media\\nL-1A Intracompany Manager or Executive\\nL-1B Intracompany Transferee (with unique or specialized knowledge)\\nO-1 Nonimmigrant of Extraordinary Ability\\nO-2 Support Personnel of an O-1\\nP-1A Internationally recognized athlete\\nP-1B Internationally recognized athlete\\nP-2 Reciprocal Exchange Visitor\\nP-3 Artist of Entertainer in a Culturally Unique Performance\\nR-1 Religious Worker\\nTN North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Professionals\\n', '\\nBelow is the list of Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers, categories and their criteria:\\nFirst preference employment-based immigrants\\nNoncitizens of extraordinary ability\\nMultinational executives\\nOutstanding professors or researchers\\n\\nSecond preference employment-based immigrants\\nMembers of the profession holding an advanced degree\\nNoncitizens of exceptional ability\\nNoncitizens seeking a national interest waiver\\n\\nThird preference employment-based immigrants\\nA professional or skilled worker\\nOther workers\\nSchedule A nurses and physical therapists\\n\\n\\nNoncitizens of extraordinary ability\\nMultinational executives\\nOutstanding professors or researchers\\n\\nMembers of the profession holding an advanced degree\\nNoncitizens of exceptional ability\\nNoncitizens seeking a national interest waiver\\n\\nA professional or skilled worker\\nOther workers\\nSchedule A nurses and physical therapists\\n', '\\nBelow is the list of Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant, categories:\\nFourth-preference employment-based immigrants\\nCertain special immigrants\\n\\n\\nCertain special immigrants\\n', '\\nBelow is the list of Form I-526, Immigrant Petition by Alien Investor, categories:\\nFifth preference employment-based immigrants (entrepreneurs)\\n\\nIf we approve a petition submitted by your prospective employer, we will send a Form I-797, Notice of Action/Approval to your employer, who will then forward it to you.

If the worker takes no action within the grace period, they and their dependents may then need to depart the United States within 60 days, or when their authorized validity period ends, whichever is shorter.\\nNonimmigrant status is typically based on an approved Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, or after admission, a subsequently approved Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status. A period of authorized stay typically includes the period when a timely filed nonfrivolous petition or application requesting an extension of stay or change of status is pending with USCIS, as described in detail below.\\nMaximum 60-Day Grace Period\\nRegulations permit a discretionary grace period that allows workers in E-1, E-2, E-3, H-1B, H-1B1, L-1, O-1, or TN classifications (and their dependents) to be considered as having maintained status in that same classification after the end of employment for up to 60 consecutive calendar days or until the end of the authorized nonimmigrant validity period, whichever is shorter (the “maximum 60-day grace period”). See 8 CFR 214.1(l)(2).\\nThe worker can preserve their period of authorized stay in the United States, however, as long as the worker timely files, if eligible, an application for a change of nonimmigrant status, an application for adjustment of status, or an application for a compelling circumstances employment authorization document, or if the worker is the beneficiary of a nonfrivolous petition to change employer before their nonimmigrant status expires.\\nIf the worker is an eligible H-1B nonimmigrant and an employer timely files a new nonfrivolous H-1B petition on their behalf, the worker can begin work immediately after USCIS receives the petition and continue to maintain their H-1B status.\\nPlease see the additional sections below for a detailed overview of these options.\\nQ: Why is the 60-day grace period important?\\nA. Before a regulatory change in 2016, there was no grace period for a terminated nonimmigrant worker. The maximum 60-day grace period provides time for a nonimmigrant worker to retain their nonimmigrant status. Alternatively, the 60-grace period provides time for the worker to request a change of status, which may allow the worker to continue their job search from within the United States, even if the grace period and the worker’s current nonimmigrant status expire. This is because a worker may remain in an authorized period of stay based on a timely filed nonfrivolous application to change to a new nonimmigrant status.\\nThe grace period also provides time for certain spouses of nonimmigrant workers to continue their own employment if they have an Employment Authorization Document or are employment-authorized incident to status.\\nWithin the grace period, eligible H-1B nonimmigrant workers may also begin employment again as soon as a new employer properly files a new H-1B petition, rather than waiting for the new petition to be approved. A worker filing for employment in another classification must wait to begin employment until the new petition is approved, but given the availability of premium processing, the wait for petition adjudication is often less than 15 days.\\nQ: When does the 60-day grace period start?\\nA: The maximum 60-day grace period starts the day after termination of employment, which is typically determined based on the last day for which a salary or wage is paid.\\nQ: How do I apply for the grace period?\\nA: USCIS will determine whether the grace period applies to your case during the adjudication of a subsequent extension of stay petition, change of status application, adjustment of status application, or compelling circumstances employment authorization application. Petitioners and applicants should state in a cover letter that they are requesting that USCIS favorably exercise its discretion to grant the up to 60-day grace period.\\nQ: Does the 60-day grace period apply to me if I voluntarily leave my job?\\nA: Yes, the up to 60-day grace period may apply to voluntary and involuntary cessation of employment.\\nQ: How many times can I use the grace period?\\nA: You are eligible for the maximum 60-day grace period once during each authorized employer petition validity period. For example, if you are terminated from Employer A, USCIS may favorably exercise its discretion to grant the grace period and consider you to have maintained status for up to 60 days. If you have a new employer petition approval with a new validity period with Employer B and are subsequently terminated, you may be eligible for another 60-day maximum grace period during the petition validity period with Employer B.\\nQ: What is my status during the grace period?\\nA: When favorably exercising its discretion, USCIS would consider you to be maintaining nonimmigrant status during the maximum 60-day grace period.\\nQ: Can I work during the grace period?\\nA: As during any period of authorized stay, employment is prohibited during the up to 60-day grace period unless otherwise authorized. As long as you remain in a period of authorized stay, which can last beyond the grace period, you remain eligible for the same options to obtain work authorization in the United States as you did during the grace period. (For more details, please see the sections below on portability, change of status, adjustment of status, and compelling circumstances Employment Authorization Documents.)\\nQ: What if my employer rehires me during the grace period?\\nA: If your petition with that employer remains valid and you are rehired in the same position, you may resume work with no further action. If you are rehired in a new or changed position, your employer may be required to file an amended or new petition to notify USCIS of any material change. If your employer notified USCIS of the termination, thus automatically revoking the petition approval, the employer would need to file a new petition with USCIS.\\nQ: Can I travel during the grace period?\\nA: The grace period ends upon any departure from the United States. If you depart the United States during the maximum 60-day grace period, you must seek another immigration status that would permit reentry.\\nQ. What happens if my employment is terminated while I am outside of the United States?\\nA: If a nonimmigrant worker is outside the United States and terminated with no notice period, or the notice period ends before the worker is able to return, then the grace period does not apply and the worker must seek another immigration status that would permit reentry. If the worker is able to, and in fact does, return to the United States before the notice period ends (that is, before the effective date of termination), the discretionary grace period may apply.\\nQ: Is my dependent spouse’s Employment Authorization Document (EAD) valid during the grace period?\\nA: Yes, if your spouse has an EAD or employment authorization incident to status, this authorization to work will remain valid during the maximum 60-day grace period.\\nQ: What happens to my post-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) EAD if my employment is terminated?\\nA: The maximum 60-day grace period only applies to workers in E-1, E-2, E-3, H-1B, H-1B1, L-1, O-1, or TN classifications (and their dependents). During post-completion OPT, F-1 status is dependent upon employment. Students may not accrue an aggregate of more than 90 days of unemployment during any post-completion OPT. Students granted 24-month Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) OPT may not accrue an aggregate of more than 150 days of unemployment during a total OPT period, including any post-completion OPT period and any subsequent 24-month extension period. See 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(E)\\nPortability of Employer Petitions\\nThere are two kinds of job portability, or “porting,” available based on two different kinds of employer petitions:\\nEligible H-1B nonimmigrants may begin working for a new employer as soon as the employer properly files a new H-1B petition (Form I-129) requesting to amend or extend H-1B status with USCIS, without waiting for the petition to be approved. More information about H-1B portability can be found on our\\xa0H-1B Specialty Occupations\\xa0page.\\nA worker with an adjustment of status application (Form I-485) that has been pending for at least 180 days with an underlying valid immigrant visa petition (Form I-140) can transfer the underlying immigrant visa petition to a qualifying new offer of employment in the same or similar occupational classification with the same or a new employer. More information about this kind of porting can be found in the\\xa0USCIS Policy Manual.\\n\\nQ: Can I port to a new H-1B employer during the grace period?\\nA: H-1B portability allows eligible H-1B nonimmigrants to change employers, or “port,” to a new H-1B employer and begin working for the new employer as soon as a nonfrivolous H-1B petition with a request to amend or extend H-1B status is properly filed with USCIS, without waiting for the new petition to be approved. For additional information please see our H-1B Specialty Occupations webpage.\\nIf you are in another status apart from H-1B, or use the grace period to change your status from H-1B to another status, you must wait for the petition with the new employer to be approved before beginning employment under the new status. As described below, however, as long as the petition or application for change of status is non-frivolous and filed before the end of the grace period (or your authorized validity period, whichever is shorter), you may remain in the United States in an authorized period of stay.\\nAlso note that premium processing can considerably reduce the wait time for adjudication of Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker.\\nQ: If I find a new H-1B employer, can my new employer file the new H-1B petition without a certified Labor Condition Application (LCA)?\\nA: No, a certified LCA is required initial evidence that must accompany a properly filed H-1B petition. LCAs are generally reviewed and certified by the Department of Labor within seven working days.\\nChange of Status\\nThe timely filing of a non-frivolous application to change status will “toll,” or stop, the accrual of unlawful presence until the application is adjudicated, as long as the applicant did not work without authorization, either before the application was filed or while it was pending, and the applicant maintained their status prior to the filing of the request for change of status.\\nFor example, if an individual files a non-frivolous application to change status before the end of the applicant’s maximum 60-day grace period, they will not accrue unlawful presence while the application remains pending, even after the maximum 60-day grace period has elapsed (again, as long as they did not work without authorization either before the application was filed or while it was pending). If the application is ultimately approved, then the individual’s status is changed, and the individual is considered to have been in a period of authorized stay for the entire time the application was pending.\\xa0 If the application is denied, then the individual starts to accrue unlawful presence the day after the denial decision. Please see our\\xa0Unlawful Presence and Inadmissibility\\xa0page for more information.\\nWorkers may use the maximum 60-day grace period to apply to change their nonimmigrant status, which, depending on eligibility, may include:\\nChanging status to become the dependent of a spouse (for example, H-4, L-2).\\xa0Some individuals in a dependent nonimmigrant status may be eligible for employment authorization incident to status, including spouses of E-1, E-2, E-3, or L-1 nonimmigrants (see the\\xa0USCIS Policy Manual). In addition, some\\xa0spouses of H-1B workers\\xa0may be eligible for employment authorization if certain requirements are met.\\nChanging status to student status (for example, F-1) or visitor status (B-1 or B-2).\\xa0Note that, by statute, B-1 and B-2 nonimmigrant visitors are specifically precluded from “performing skilled or unskilled labor” in the United States. Certain F-1 students, by regulation, may engage in\\xa0limited employment. For more information, please see our\\xa0Change My Nonimmigrant Status\\xa0page.\\nSeeking a new employer-sponsored nonimmigrant status in the same or different status. For example, depending on the specific facts presented, an L-1 worker may be eligible for new employment under the TN, E-3, or H-1B1 classifications. The timely filing of a non-frivolous change of status petition by a prospective employer will prevent the accrual of unlawful presence until the petition is adjudicated (see above), as long as the worker did not engage in employment without authorization either before the petition was filed or while it was pending. Such a filing alone will not, however, confer employment authorization in the new position while the petition is pending, and will not extend employment authorization if the original classification is no longer valid. Some petitions may be eligible for premium processing\\xa0for an additional fee. Potential pathways for noncitizen STEM professionals can be found on our\\xa0Options for Noncitizen STEM Professionals to Work in the United States\\xa0page.\\n\\nQ: Can my change of status petition or application be expedited?\\nA: You may request that USCIS expedite the adjudication of your pending Form I-539 application. USCIS will consider all expedite requests on a case-by-case basis and has the discretion to approve an expedite request if one of the prescribed USCIS expedite criteria has been met. USCIS generally does not consider expedite requests for petitions and applications if premium processing service is available (as are all I-129 petitions).\\nQ: How soon can I start working if I change my status to an employment-authorized dependent status?\\nA: Employment is authorized incident to status for certain E and L nonimmigrant spouses; those individuals may begin working as soon as the change of status, if granted, takes effect (typically upon approval of the change of status application). Individuals in other dependent statuses, if eligible for employment authorization, will need to apply for employment authorization by filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and may begin working after approval.\\nQ: Will my pending I-539 change of status application to B-1 or B-2 be prioritized if I find a new employer who files an I-129 petition with a request for premium processing service?\\nA: If an employer files a Form I-129 petition on your behalf, along with a request for premium processing service, USCIS will generally process the pending I-539 and the I-129 together during the premium processing timeframe and issue concurrent decisions. This means there should be no delay in adjudication of the I-129 because of the pending I-539. No formal request is required for the pending I-539 to be prioritized. If USCIS approves the I-129 petition, including any requested change of status, then you generally will obtain the nonimmigrant status requested on the I-129 petition (not the I-539), and may begin working. You generally would not need to depart the United States to obtain the requested nonimmigrant status in this scenario.\\nQ: Can I file a change of status to B-1 or B-2 if I have a pending or approved I-140?\\nA: Yes, having a pending or approved I-140 should have no impact on your change of status request, so long as you maintain an intent to depart after any approved temporary period of stay and continue to maintain a residence abroad that you do not intend to abandon.\\nQ: Can I look for a new job while in B-1 or B-2 status?\\nA: Yes, searching for employment and interviewing for a position are permissible B-1 or B-2 activities. By statute, however, you may not engage in employment within the domestic labor market (also known as “local labor for hire”) while in B-1 status or engage in any employment while in B-2 status. Before beginning any new employment, a petition and request for a change of status from B-1 or B-2 to an employment-authorized status must be approved, and the new status must take effect. Alternatively, if the change of status request is denied or the petition for new employment requested consular or port of entry notification, the individual must depart the United States and be admitted in an employment-authorized classification before beginning the new employment.\\nQ: What happens if my prospective employer’s new petition or my application is denied? Can I file an appeal or a motion?\\nA: Denial of a request for change of status or extension of stay may not be appealed. However, your employer may appeal a denial of the underlying petition on your behalf (if that case type is within the appellate jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Office. Your employer may also file a motion on a denial of your change or extension request. Both appeals and motions are filed on Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion. Note that the filing of an appeal or motion will not stop the accrual of unlawful presence – it will continue to accrue.\\xa0If the motion is granted and the underlying application or petition is approved, the change or extension of status may also be approved if otherwise eligible and you will not have accrued unlawful presence.\\nAdjustment of Status\\nSome workers may be eligible to file a self-petitioned immigrant visa petition concurrently with an adjustment of status application. Examples of immigrant classifications that are eligible for self-petitioning include\\xa0EB-1 Extraordinary Ability\\xa0and EB-5 Immigrant Investor. Workers with a pending adjustment application are generally eligible to remain in the United States in a period of authorized stay and obtain an Employment Authorization Document (EAD).\\nCompelling Circumstances Employment Authorization Document\\nWorkers who are the beneficiary of an approved employment-based immigrant visa petition (Form I-140) may be eligible for a compelling circumstances Employment Authorization Document (EAD) for up to one year if they:\\nDo not have an immigrant visa available to them based on the Department of State’s Visa Bulletin; and\\nFace compelling circumstances.\\n\\nA compelling circumstances EAD is a discretionary stopgap measure intended to assist certain individuals on the path to lawful permanent resident status by preventing the need to abruptly leave the United States. Workers who begin employment on a compelling circumstances EAD will no longer be maintaining nonimmigrant status but generally will be considered to be in a period of authorized stay, and will not accrue unlawful presence in the United States while the EAD is valid. More information about eligibility requirements and the application process can be found on our\\xa0Employment Authorization in Compelling Circumstances page.\\nQ: What is a compelling circumstances EAD?\\nA: In limited circumstances, USCIS may issue an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) that allows certain noncitizens facing compelling circumstances to work for any U.S. employer. Applying for a compelling circumstances EAD may be an option to remain working in the United States if other options are not available to you. A compelling circumstances EAD may assist certain individuals who already have an approved I-140, and face compelling circumstances, but who are not yet eligible to file an adjustment of status application or apply for an immigrant visa because a visa is not yet available based on their priority date, country of chargeability, and preference category. More information about eligibility requirements and the application process can be found on our\\xa0Employment Authorization in Compelling Circumstances page.\\nQ: What is my immigration status and work authorization if I’m within the grace period while a compelling circumstances EAD application is pending?\\nA: USCIS may consider you to be maintaining nonimmigrant status during the maximum 60-day grace period. If you file a nonfrivolous application for a compelling circumstances EAD during the grace period you will not accrue unlawful presence, even if the application remains pending after the grace period ends. However, you may not work during this period unless otherwise authorized.\\nQ: What happens if I have a compelling circumstances EAD application approved, but a change of status application is still pending?\\nA: If the compelling circumstances EAD is approved, you are authorized for employment based on compelling circumstances. If your I-94 has expired, you will not be in a nonimmigrant status, however you will be considered as being in a period of authorized stay during the EAD validity period. If your compelling circumstances EAD application is approved, and you work using the compelling circumstances EAD or are no longer maintaining your nonimmigrant status, you will not be eligible to change your status in the United States.\\nQ: What will happen if I make an expedite request for my compelling circumstances EAD application?\\nA: The USCIS Contact Center will create and forward a service request for consideration for expeditious handling on your behalf to the office with jurisdiction over your application. The reviewing office will contact you if additional information is required to process your expedite request. You will receive a notice from USCIS with a decision to either approve or deny your expedite request.\\nQ: Can I still file an Adjustment of Status application (Form I-485) if I am working based on a compelling circumstances EAD?\\nA: If you are working in the United States under a compelling circumstances EAD and your immigrant visa priority date becomes current, you generally would not be eligible to file Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence of Adjust Status. Instead, you would need to request USCIS to notify the Department of State’s National Visa Center (NVC) if your immigrant petition is approved so that you may process your immigrant visa application abroad. For more information on immigrant visa processing, please see the NVC Processing web page.\\nQ: What happens if I am working based on a compelling circumstances EAD and a new employer files an I-129 on my behalf?\\nA: If you are working in the United States under a compelling circumstances EAD and a new Form I-129 petition is filed on your behalf, you would not be granted a change of status or extension of stay. After the petition is approved for a new work-authorized classification, you would need to apply for a visa and/or admission from outside the United States to begin working.\\nQ: Are my spouse and children eligible for a compelling circumstances EAD?\\nA: Yes, your spouse and children may be eligible for a compelling circumstances EAD. They must be in valid nonimmigrant status at the time of filing the compelling circumstances EAD application. Your spouse and children may file their applications concurrently with your application, but their applications cannot be approved until after your application is approved. The validity period of employment authorization granted to your spouse and children may not extend beyond the validity of your employment authorization.\\xa0\\nExpedite Criteria\\nSome circumstances may warrant expedited adjudication, including applications to change status to a dependent status that includes eligibility for employment authorization. For example, an application to change status from H-1B to L-2 may be eligible for expedited adjudication to prevent severe financial loss. See the\\xa0How to Make an Expedite Request\\xa0page for additional information. Please note that USCIS generally does not consider expedite requests for petitions and applications if premium processing service is available.\\nDeparture from the United States\\nNotwithstanding the above options to extend a period of authorized stay, workers may choose to depart the United States. For H-1B and O workers who chose to depart the United States after involuntary cessation of employment, the H-1B employer or the O employer and O petitioner, as applicable, must pay the reasonable costs of transportation to the worker’s last place of foreign residence. In addition, for O workers, both the employer and the petitioner are jointly and severally liable for the reasonable cost of return transportation. (See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(E) and 8 CFR 214.2(o)(16).)\\nOnce abroad, H-1B holders may seek U.S. employment and readmission to the United States for any remaining period of their H-1B status. Those seeking another classification for which they may be eligible can complete the application or petition process abroad and seek readmission to the United States.', '\\nThis temporary employment authorization may be provided to certain nonimmigrants who are the beneficiaries of approved employment-based immigrant visa petitions and their qualifying spouse and children, and who are caught in the continually expanding backlogs for immigrant visas and face compelling circumstances. This stopgap measure is intended to address certain particularly difficult situations, including those that previously may have forced individuals on the path to lawful permanent residence to abruptly stop working and leave the United States.\\xa0Read our Policy Manual for more detailed information, as well as our resource on Options for Nonimmigrant Workers Following Termination of Employment.\\nCategory (c)(35) is for principal beneficiaries of approved Form I-140s who are in the United States in E-3, H-1B, H-1B1, L-1, or O-1 nonimmigrant status and are applying for an initial grant of employment authorization based on “compelling circumstances,” or a renewal of such authorization.\\nCategory (c)(36) is for qualifying dependent spouses and children of a principal beneficiary granted employment authorization under category (c)(35).\\n\\nUSCIS may grant employment authorization and issue an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) in these two categories for up to one year if we determine that there are compelling circumstances that justify issuing employment authorization.\\nNOTE:\\xa0USCIS considers an applicant with a valid EAD based on compelling circumstances to be in a period of authorized stay by the Secretary of Homeland Security. If you receive a compelling circumstances EAD, and begin working based on this EAD, you will be in a period of authorized stay, but you will no longer be maintaining your nonimmigrant status. However, you generally will not accrue unlawful presence in the U.S. while the EAD is valid or, if you filed a non-frivolous application on time, while your application is pending.\\nEligibility Requirements\\nYou are eligible to apply for an initial EAD under category (c)(35) if you:\\nAre in the United States in E-3, H-1B, H-1B1, O-1, or L-1 nonimmigrant status, including in any applicable grace period, on the date you file the application for employment authorization;\\nAre the principal beneficiary of an approved Form I-140;\\nCan establish that an immigrant visa is not authorized for issuance to you based on your priority date, preference category, and country of chargeability according to the\\xa0Final Action Date\\xa0in effect according to the Department of State’s Visa Bulletin on the date you file your application for employment authorization; and\\nCan demonstrate that compelling circumstances exist that would justify USCIS using its discretion to issue you an independent grant of employment authorization.\\n\\nIf you want to renew an EAD under category (c)(35), please see the Renewing Your Employment Authorization section below.\\nYour family members may also apply for employment authorization under category (c)(36).

VIBE uses commercially available data from an independent information provider (IIP) to validate basic information about companies or organizations petitioning to employ certain noncitizens and to validate the basic information about the companies or organizations listed on:\\nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker;\\nForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker;\\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant; and\\nForm I-485 Supplement J, Confirmation of Bona Fide Job Offer or Request for Job Portability Under INA Section 204(j).\\n\\nFor additional information, please\\xa0visit the\\xa0VIBE Questions and Answers\\xa0page.\\nCurrently, Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) is the independent information provider for the VIBE program.\\nBackground\\nWhen adjudicating employment-based petitions or applications, USCIS must primarily rely on paper documentation supplied by the petitioning company or organization to establish the petitioner’s eligibility for the requested classification or by the applicant to confirm a bona fide job offer or request job portability.\\nWhen the paperwork does not sufficiently document the evidence required under the law, USCIS must issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) for additional documentation, delaying final adjudication of the petition or application.\\nThe VIBE program has been introduced to address some of these issues.\\nVIBE Program\\nVIBE allows USCIS to electronically receive commercially available information from an IIP, currently D&B,\\xa0about a company or an organization. This information includes:\\nBusiness activities, such as type of business (North American Industry Classification System code), trade payment information, and status (active or inactive)\\nFinancial standing, including sales volume and credit standing\\nNumber of employees, both on-site and globally\\nRelationships with other entities, including foreign affiliates\\nType of office (examples include single entities, branches, subsidiaries and headquarters)\\nType of legal entity (for example, LLC, partnership or corporation)\\nCompany executives\\nDate of establishment as a business entity\\nCurrent physical address\\n\\nUSCIS officers review all information received through VIBE along with the evidence submitted by the petitioner or applicant and will use the information from VIBE to verify the petitioner’s qualifications. For example, if a petitioner is seeking L-1 status for a beneficiary, VIBE will help USCIS officers confirm that the petitioner has a foreign affiliate, which is a requirement for granting L-1 status. They will also use the information from VIBE to validate the bona fides of the employer when certain employment-based applicants file for lawful permanent resident status.\\nInformation from VIBE will also help to confirm an employer's financial viability and operational status for petitions and applications where a job offer is required. USCIS will not deny a petition or an application solely based upon information from VIBE. If USCIS officers find significant data discrepancy between the evidence submitted by the petitioner or applicant and the information presented in VIBE, they will give the petitioner or applicant the opportunity to respond to the agency’s concerns. USCIS may issue an RFE or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) if it is necessary to resolve relevant inconsistencies or other issues that emerge upon review of VIBE-supplied information that are material to the benefit requested.\\nUSCIS will then make a final decision based on the totality of the circumstances.\\nYour Company’s or Organization’s Information in VIBE\\nUSCIS does not require companies and organizations to create or update records with D&B; however, you may choose to create, verify, or correct your company or organization’s information with D&B.\\nIf your entity is a U.S.-based privately held company or organization and you would like to create, verify or correct its D&B record, you may contact D&B directly online through iUpdate for U.S. government customers.

VIBE is a web-based tool that uses commercially available data to validate basic information about companies or organizations petitioning to employ certain aliens and to validate the basic information about the companies or organizations listed on the Form I-485 Supplement J. A main goal of VIBE is to equip USCIS Officers with information from an independent source that they can use to help determine petitioners’ or applicants’ eligibility.\\nQ2. Which petitions or applications are included in VIBE?\\nA2. VIBE includes most employment-based petitions filed by companies and organizations and also validates the bona fides of the employer when certain employment-based applicants file for lawful permanent resident status, including:\\nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker.\\nForm I-140, Immigration Petition for Alien Worker.\\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er) or Special Immigrant.\\nForm I-485 Supplement J, \\xa0Confirmation of Bona Fide Job Offer or Request for Job Portability Under INA Section 204(j)\\n\\tSee\\xa0uscis.gov/vibe\\xa0for a complete list of immigrant and nonimmigrant classifications included in VIBE.\\nAt this time, VIBE is not used for the following employment-based petition classifications due to their unique eligibility requirements:\\n\\n\\nSee\\xa0uscis.gov/vibe\\xa0for a complete list of immigrant and nonimmigrant classifications included in VIBE.\\nAt this time, VIBE is not used for the following employment-based petition classifications due to their unique eligibility requirements:\\nCW-1, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)-only transitional worker\\nE-2C, long-term foreign investors in the CNMI\\nE11, individuals of extraordinary ability\\nE21, national interest waiver\\nEB-5, immigrant investor\\nO, individuals with extraordinary ability or achievement (including essential support personnel)\\nP, internationally recognized athletes and entertainment groups, performers under a reciprocal exchange program, and artists or entertainers under a culturally unique program (including essential support personnel)\\n\\nQ3.

Will a final decision be based solely on information obtained through VIBE?\\nA4. No. VIBE is an additional tool for USCIS officers to use in the overall adjudicative process. USCIS will not deny a petition or an application solely based upon information from VIBE. USCIS will issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) if derogatory or contradictory information is found in VIBE that is material to the benefit requested and is not outweighed by evidence submitted with the petition or application. USCIS will make a final decision based on the totality of the circumstances.\\nQ5. How will I know if I received an RFE or NOID due to a VIBE-related issue?\\nA5. The RFE or NOID will clearly state that the employer information has been checked in VIBE, and will describe the relevant derogatory or contradictory information found.\\nQ6. If I receive an RFE or NOID for a VIBE-related issue, am I required to update my company’s record with D&B?\\nA6. No. \\xa0However, you may choose to contact D&B to update the record to prevent any future applications or petitions from receiving a similar RFE or NOID for the VIBE-related issue in question.\\nYou must respond to USCIS with the information requested in the RFE or NOID regardless of whether you choose to update your record with D&B.\\nQ7. Do I need to respond to USCIS if I update my company’s record with D&B after receiving an RFE or NOID?\\nA7. Yes. You must respond to USCIS with the requested additional information after receiving an RFE or a NOID. Updating your company’s record with D&B is not a substitute for responding to USCIS’ RFE or NOID. If you do not respond to the RFE or NOID directly to USCIS, we may deny your petition or application.\\xa0\\nQ8. Are there any additional USCIS fees for filing a petition or an application subject to VIBE?\\nA8. No. There are no additional fees associated with VIBE. You must still comply with all other fee requirements for the requested classification. Visit uscis.gov/fees for information about current fees.\\nQ9. Does VIBE require any additional documentary filing requirements?\\nA9. No. VIBE does not require you to file additional documentation. However, it is critical that you accurately provide your business name and address on the USCIS form. This helps USCIS match information from the form with information received through VIBE. If you list an attorney’s or representative’s address in the form’s Petitioner Information section or Employer Information section, USCIS may issue you an RFE.\\nQ10. When filing a Form I-140 for a classification included in VIBE, do I still need to submit evidence of ability to pay?\\nA10. Yes. You must continue to submit evidence with a Form I-140 to demonstrate the organization’s ability to pay the proffered wage from the time the priority date was established until the beneficiary obtains lawful permanent resident status.\\nAlthough VIBE helps USCIS Officers by independently validating an employer’s business operations, the information provided to USCIS through VIBE is not a substitute for the required evidence of ability to pay specified in the regulations.\\nQ11. How will using VIBE affect processing times for employment-based petitions or applications?\\nA11. The use of VIBE will not change USCIS’s overall processing-time goals as long as no relevant derogatory or contradictory information is found. If derogatory or contradictory information is found, you may experience prolonged processing due to the time required to complete the RFE, NOID or administrative inquiry. On the other hand, the use of VIBE may allow USCIS to resolve inconsistencies in the record, potentially reducing the need to issue RFEs.\\nUSCIS’s goal for VIBE is to gradually reduce processing times for most employment-based petitions.', '\\nQ12. How can I view the information in my company’s or organization’s D&B report?\\nA12. As of December 2011, a U.S.-based privately held company or organization may view, at no cost, the basic elements contained in its D&B report by using D&B’s new\\xa0Update for US government customers.\\nContacting D&B from this link will allow U.S.-based privately held USCIS petitioners and other U.S. government customers to create, update and view their company’s or organization’s D&B record without being subjected to direct marketing from D&B.\\nWhen using this process for government customers, D&B must verify the user’s personal identity and affiliation with the selected company or organization. Update for U.S. government customers users will be asked a series of short challenge questions, based on geographical and demographic data, to authenticate and establish an ID and password. Only those with access to your established ID and password will be able to access your business’ or organization’s information.\\nFor additional information of how D&B collects, manages, shares and protects information, please review its privacy policy at\\xa0dnb.com/US/home/privacy_policy/index.html.\\nTo maintain accuracy of significant business information, D&B requires certain change requests to be verified by a third party prior to entry into the D&B system. If verification cannot be confirmed, the change request will be denied. This policy exists to protect companies and organizations from possible identity theft and fraud.\\nD&B’s iUpdate for U.S. government customers is not available to U.S.-based publicly traded companies, government entities or foreign companies. Such entities wishing to create, update or view their report with D&B may use\\xa0dnb.com. Organizations accessing dnb.com may be subjected to direct marketing from D&B.\\nQ13. Is there a fee for viewing or updating my company or organization’s information or D&B report?\\nA13. No. There is no fee for a company or organization to create a record with D&B, view the basic elements in the D&B report or update its information with D&B. USCIS does not require an employer to purchase products or services from D&B in order to ensure its information is accurate, nor does USCIS\\xa0require the employer to pay any fee to expedite the creation of a new record or for the updating of an existing record with D&B. Moreover, the use of D&B as an IIP for VIBE is not in any way an endorsement of D&B or its services.\\nQ14. When I requested my report from D&B, I found that D&B does not yet have any information about my company or organization. What should I do?\\nA14. USCIS does not require employers’ information to be available through D&B when they file with USCIS.\\nD&B has developed a 9-digit identification sequence, known as the D-U-N-S® Number, that provides a unique identifier of single business entities while linking corporate family structures together. You may request a D-U-N-S® Number from D&B if you find that the firm does not yet have any information about your company or organization. However, USCIS does not require employers to have a D-U-N-S® Number or include a D-U-N-S® Number when filing with USCIS.\\nIt is important to note that USCIS will not automatically issue an RFE or NOID if an employer’s information is not included in the D&B database. As part of the adjudication, USCIS will also review information found in the evidence submitted with the petition or application and, if needed, additional publicly available information (such as the relevant Office of the Secretary of State’s business registrations). USCIS will make a final decision based on the totality of the circumstances.\\nA U.S.-based privately held company or organization may contact D&B to request a D-U-N-S® Number by using D&B’s iUpdate for US government customers. U.S.-based publicly traded companies, government entities and foreign entities may contact D&B via dnb.com.\\nFor more information about the D-U-N-S® Number, visit\\xa0dnb.com.\\nQ15. How long does it take for D&B to update information about a company or organization?\\nA15. D&B generally completes its verification process within 2 to 7 business days, upon which the updated information is included in the customer’s record. D&B generally fulfills requests for new D-U-N-S® Numbers within 30 days. You may contact D&B for more information.\\nQ16. If I contact D&B through the iUpdate service for U.S. government customers, will I be offered commercial services or products?\\nA16. No. By contacting D&B through this link, certain USCIS customers and other U.S. government customers will be able to create, update and view the basic elements of their company’s or organization’s D&B report without being subjected to direct marketing from D&B.\\nQ17. If I contact D&B through their website, can I be offered commercial services or products from D&B?\\nA17. Yes. USCIS wants to ensure that the public is aware that D&B representatives may suggest that you purchase products and services from them if you contact D&B through\\xa0dnb.com. However, USCIS does not endorse D&B or its products or services, and does not in any way suggest that you purchase products or services from D&B in order to ensure your information is complete. Additionally, USCIS does not in any way suggest that you pay any fee to expedite the creation of a new record or to update an existing record.\\nPlease send questions and comments about VIBE to\\xa0VIBE-Feedback@dhs.gov.', '\\nU.S. employers must check to make sure all employees, regardless of citizenship or national origin, are allowed to work in the United States.

First, you will need to consider whether you intend to employ the individual permanently or temporarily. Offering an noncitizen a permanent position could provide the basis for that individual to become a permanent resident, a process which will require that the individual file an additional application and satisfy separate requirements.\\nPermanent Workers\\nForeign workers may obtain permanent residence (a Green Card) if they are able to establish that they have unique skills, or are being offered a job in the United States that will not displace a U.S. worker or have an adverse effect on wages and working conditions of U.S. workers who are similarly employed. This latter determination is made by the Department of Labor and is demonstrated by obtaining a labor certification.\\nPermanent worker visas are broken into five preference categories. For a description of the preference categories, see the\\xa0Permanent Workers\\xa0page.\\nDepartment of Labor: Labor Certification\\nA U.S. employer who is “sponsoring” or petitioning for a permanent foreign worker may be required to obtain a labor certification from the Department of Labor (DOL) verifying that there are an insufficient number of available, qualified, and willing U.S. workers to fill the position, and that the employment will not have an adverse effect on the wages and working conditions of similarly situated U.S. workers.

See the Oct. 12, 2021, DHS Policy Statement 065-06, “Worksite Enforcement: The Strategy to Protect the American Labor Market, the Conditions of the American Worksite, and the Dignity of the Individual.”\\nWorkers are sometimes afraid to report violations of law by exploitative employers or to cooperate in employment and labor standards investigations because they fear removal or other immigration-related retaliation due to reports by an abusive employer. DHS’s practice of offering discretionary protection on a case-by-case basis to victims who lack employment authorization directly increases the ability of labor and employment agencies to more fully investigate worksite violations. Offering discretionary protection also supports these agencies in fulfilling their mission and holding abusive employers accountable, which protects all U.S. workers. The process changes announced today will streamline the exercise of DHS’s existing authority to grant such protection.\\nFor Labor Agencies Submitting a Statement of Interest Form\\nMultiple mechanisms in our immigration laws can provide employment authorization to noncitizen workers and protect them from removal, including discretionary relief such as deferred action or parole in place and other forms of relief such as T and U nonimmigrant visas. There are also circumstances where a labor or employment agency may request expedited processing of a worker’s pending application, petition, or request.\\nLabor and employment agencies can seek DHS support in an ongoing investigation or enforcement action by contacting laborenforcement@dhs.gov, and including “a statement of interest” that addresses the following:\\nDetails the nature of their investigation and the need for DHS support;\\nDescribes the agency’s enforcement interests that provide the basis for their request;\\nDescribes the worksite and the workers who may be helpful with the agency investigation; and\\nProvides an agency point of contact who can address follow up questions from DHS.\\n\\nIn addition, labor agencies can seek expedited processing of a worker’s pending immigration benefit request. Such requests must be made by a senior-level official. If the request relates to employment authorization, the request should demonstrate that the need for a person to be employment-authorized is mission-critical and goes beyond a general need to retain a particular worker or person. Examples include, but are not limited to, a noncitizen victim or witness cooperating with a federal, state, or local agency who is in need of employment authorization because the respective agency is seeking back pay or reinstatement in an enforcement action or other court proceeding.\\xa0When labor agencies submit a Statement of Interest, DHS aims to review submissions within 3 business days. DHS will notify the labor agency whether the Statement of Interest has been accepted or whether further information is needed. Labor agencies should not distribute the Statement of Interest until DHS has confirmed acceptance.\\xa0\\nIf a labor agency would like more information before submitting a Statement of Interest, please e-mail laborenforcement@dhs.gov to request a briefing with DHS.\\nProcess for Workers Requesting Deferred Action\\nDeferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action (deportation) against a noncitizen for a certain period. Although deferred action does not confer lawful status or excuse any past or future periods of unlawful presence, a noncitizen granted deferred action is considered lawfully present in the United States for certain limited purposes while the deferred action is in effect. DHS can terminate deferred action at any time, at its discretion.\\nUnder existing regulations, a noncitizen granted deferred action may apply for and obtain employment authorization for the period of deferred action if they demonstrate “an economic necessity for employment.”\\nNoncitizen workers who fall within the scope of a labor agency investigation can submit their requests for deferred action to USCIS through a central intake point specifically established to handle requests for deferred action related to labor agency investigative efforts. USCIS will forward to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) any requests for deferred action from noncitizens who are in removal proceedings or have a final order of removal, so ICE can consider the request for deferred action.\\nAs with any request for deferred action, DHS will review requests based on a labor agency investigation on a case-by-case basis. DHS will review all positive and negative factors when considering whether to exercise discretion to grant deferred action.\\nTo request labor agency-investigation-based deferred action under this centralized intake process, requestors must submit the following:\\nA written request signed by the noncitizen stating the basis for the deferred action request;\\nA letter or statement of interest from a labor or employment agency addressed to DHS supporting the request;\\nEvidence to establish that the worker falls within the scope identified in the labor or employment agency letter, such as W-2s, pay stubs, time cards, or other documentary evidence to demonstrate that the worker was employed during the period identified in the labor or employment agency statement;\\nEvidence of any additional factors supporting a favorable exercise of discretion;\\nProof of the noncitizen’s identity and nationality;\\nIf applicable, any document used to lawfully enter the United States or other evidence relating to the noncitizen’s immigration history or status;\\nForm G-325A, Biographic Information (for Deferred Action);\\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with the appropriate fee or request for a fee waiver; and\\nForm I-765WS, Worksheet\\n\\nSubmit these materials to:\\nUSCIS\\nAttn: Deferred Action\\n10 Application Way\\nMontclair, CA 91763-1350\\nFAQs\\nQ1: What is deferred action?\\nA1: Deferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action (deportation) against a noncitizen for a certain period. Although deferred action does not confer lawful status or excuse any past or future periods of unlawful presence, a noncitizen granted deferred action is considered lawfully present in the United States for certain limited purposes, while the deferred action is in effect. If granted deferred action, a noncitizen may be eligible for employment authorization. DHS can terminate deferred action at any time, at its discretion.\\nQ2. Has DHS already granted deferred action to noncitizens who are participating in labor agency investigations?\\nA2. Yes. DHS grants deferred action to noncitizen workers on a case-by-case basis at its discretion.\\nQ3. How does the centralized deferred action process work?\\nA3. A noncitizen requesting labor agency investigation-based deferred action submits a written request for deferred action by submitting:\\nA request for deferred action signed by the noncitizen which describes the basis for their request for deferred action;\\nA copy of the letter issued by the labor or employment agency addressed to DHS detailing the nature of the investigation or prosecution and the need for DHS support;\\nEvidence to establish that the worker falls within the category of workers identified in the labor or employment agency’s letter, such as W-2s, pay stubs, time cards, or other documentary evidence to demonstrate that the worker was employed during the period in the labor or employment agency statement;\\nEvidence of any additional factors supporting a favorable exercise of discretion;\\nProof of the noncitizen’s identity and nationality;\\nIf applicable, any document used to lawfully enter the U.S. or other evidence relating to the noncitizen’s immigration history or status;\\nForm G-325A, Biographic Information (for Deferred Action);\\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with the applicable, non-refundable fee; and, Application for Employment Authorization, with the applicable, non-refundable fee; and\\nForm G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, if applicable.\\n\\nThe noncitizen will submit this request to a central intake point at USCIS specifically established to support labor agency investigative and enforcement efforts. USCIS will refer to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) any deferred action requests that fall within ICE’s authority, including requests submitted by noncitizens who are in removal proceedings or have a final order of removal.\\nAs with any request for deferred action, DHS will review requests by workers based on a labor agency investigation on a case-by-case basis. DHS will review all positive and negative factors present in the requestor’s case when considering whether to exercise discretion to grant deferred action.\\nA worker who is participating in or otherwise involved in a labor agency investigation may request deferred action for a period of up to two years.\\nQ4. Can a noncitizen worker who would otherwise fit within the scope of a labor-related request for prosecutorial discretion described in this FAQ but who does not want to submit a Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, request deferred action?\\nA4. Yes. A noncitizen worker who falls within the scope of a labor agency investigation but who does not want to submit a Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, may request deferred action by submitting their request to the appropriate field office in accordance with the general instructions for requesting deferred action.\\nQ5. May a noncitizen granted deferred action be eligible for employment authorization?\\nA5. Individuals granted deferred action may be eligible for employment authorization under category 8 C.F.R. 274a.12(c)(14), under existing regulations that require them to demonstrate an economic necessity for employment. Noncitizens submitting a deferred action request through this centralized process must concurrently submit their Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with the appropriate fee. If we grant deferred action, we will adjudicate the Form I-765. Note that if we do not grant deferred action, we will not refund or return the Form I-765 fee. If the requestor does not want to file Form I-765, they can send their request using the standard procedure (sending it to the USCIS field office).\\nQ6. What agency will be reviewing requests for deferred action from noncitizen workers?\\nA6. Requests for deferred action made by noncitizen workers who are participating in or otherwise necessary to a labor agency investigation may be submitted to USCIS through the central intake point specifically established to support labor agency investigative efforts for deferred action requests. USCIS will review the request, as well as the worker’s immigration history, to determine which office within DHS has authority over the request. Upon reviewing the submission for completeness, USCIS will only forward to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) requests for deferred action that are submitted by noncitizens who are in removal proceedings or have a final order of removal. USCIS and ICE, as appropriate, will consider and make a case-by-case determination of the deferred action request and USCIS will consider all related Forms I-765, if submitted.\\nQ7. If deferred action is granted through this process, when does it end?\\nA7. If deferred action is approved, it may be granted for a period of up to two years, subject to termination at any time. The recipient may also be eligible to make subsequent requests for deferred action, which will be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis when a labor agency provides a basis for such a request as it relates to the labor agency’s ongoing investigative or enforcement interests.\\nQ8. What other immigration benefits can a noncitizen worker pursue if they are not granted deferred action?\\nA8. A noncitizen worker who is the victim of a crime or subject to exploitation by an unscrupulous employer and cooperating in a labor agency investigation may be eligible for other forms of immigration relief beyond deferred action, including eligibility for a T or U nonimmigrant visa or parole in place.\\nQ9.\\xa0How can a labor agency find out more about this process?\\nA9. Labor agency representatives can contact laborenforcement@dhs.gov to learn more about this process.\\nQ10.\\xa0A labor agency submitted a Statement of Interest. Can the labor agency distribute the Statement of Interest to workers to submit as part of their deferred action request?\\nA10. When labor agencies submit a Statement of Interest, DHS aims to review submissions within 3 business days. DHS will notify the labor agency whether the Statement of Interest has been accepted or whether further information is needed. Labor agencies should not distribute the Statement of Interest until DHS has confirmed acceptance.\\nQ11: Will I receive a Social Security Number?\\nA11. In most cases, when you apply for employment authorization using Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, you can apply for a Social Security Number (SSN) and a new or replacement Social Security card on the same form. If USCIS approves your Form I-765 and you completed the section on the application authorizing USCIS to provide your information to the Social Security Administration (SSA), then USCIS will send SSA the data needed to assign you a SSN and issue your Social Security card.\\nIn such cases, if USCIS approves your Form I-765, then you will receive two documents – your Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document, also known as an EAD, from USCIS, and in another envelope from SSA, your Social Security card.\\xa0The SSA will mail your Social Security card to the address you listed on your Form I-765.\\xa0You should receive your Social Security card no later than seven business days after you receive your EAD from USCIS.\\nIf you do not receive your SSN card within seven business days after receiving your EAD, please call or visit an SSA office. For more information, please review this flyer: Apply for your Social Security Number While Applying for your Work Permit (PDF, 400.77 KB).\\nQ12: Will DHS consider a request submitted by a labor or employment agency to expedite a worker’s pending immigration benefit request on the basis of a labor agency’s need?\\nA12. Yes. On a case-by-case basis, USCIS will consider a request submitted by a senior-level official of the labor or employment agency for expedited processing of a worker’s pending immigration benefit request, including but not limited to Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, submitted outside of a request for labor investigation-based deferred action under the centralized intake process, Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, From I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, U Bona Fide Determination, or other pending immigration benefit request.\\nIf the expedite request relates to employment authorization, the request should demonstrate\\xa0\\xa0 a critical and otherwise compelling need for a person to be employment-authorized.

Your sponsoring agency will provide you this form. You should work closely with the officials at your sponsoring agency who will be assisting you through this process. An official who is authorized to issue Form DS-2019 is known as a responsible officer (RO) or alternate responsible officer (ARO). Your RO or ARO will explain to you what documents are needed in order to be issued a DS-2019.\\nAfter you have obtained a Form DS-2019, you may then apply for a J-1 visa through the U.S. Department of State at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. The waiting time for an interview appointment for applicants can vary, so submitting your visa application as early as possible is strongly encouraged (though you may not enter the United States in J-1 status more than 30 days before your program begins).\\nEmployment\\nSome J-1 nonimmigrants enter the United States specifically to work while others do not.

DOS will notify the J-1\\xa0foreign medical graduate, attorney of record (if applicable), and the state agency that requested the waiver by mail.\\nUSCIS will make a final determination on whether to approve the waiver application. Upon a favorable recommendation by DOS-WRD, USCIS will generally grant the waiver as long as there are no underlying concerns. USCIS will provide written notice of its decision to the J-1 foreign medical graduate and their representative (if applicable).\\nIf DOS-WRD recommends the waiver:\\nThe petitioner must submit Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, along with the DOS-WRD favorable recommendation letter, in order to request a change of the J-1 foreign medical graduate’s nonimmigrant status to H-1B.\\nThe spouse and/or child of the waiver recipient must submit Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, in order to change status from J-2 to H-4 nonimmigrant status.\\nThe J-1 foreign medical graduate must practice medicine for at least 3 years in an area designated by HHS as a HPSA, MUA, or MUP, or, in some cases, serve patients in such an area.\\n\\nOnce the Conrad 30 waiver recipient has fulfilled all terms and conditions imposed on the waiver, including the 3-year period of employment with the health care facility under their approved contract, they (and their spouse and/or child) will become eligible to apply for:\\nAn immigrant visa\\nAdjustment of status\\nAn H or L nonimmigrant visa\\n\\nIf the waiver recipient fails to fulfill the terms and conditions imposed on the waiver, they (and their spouse and/or child) will once again become subject to the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the INA.\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\nQ1. Does a J-1 foreign medical graduate need to file Form I-612, Application for Waiver of the Foreign Residence Requirement, in order to apply for a Conrad 30 Waiver?\\nA1. No, the Form I-612 is not required.\\nQ.2 The law requires the recipient of a Conrad 30 waiver to work full-time for three continuous years. What is the definition of “full-time” work?\\nA2. DOS considers “full-time” employment to be 40 hours per week.\\nQ3. If a J-1 foreign medical graduate is granted a Conrad 30 waiver and H-1B status, may he or she change employers if the original health care facility closes?\\nA3. Depending on the circumstances, USCIS may consider the closure of the health care facility named in the waiver application an extenuating circumstance excusing early termination of employment. A J-1 foreign medical graduate who is granted a Conrad 30 waiver and H-1B status must comply with the terms and conditions of that nonimmigrant status. USCIS may, however excuse early termination of the 3-year period of employment with the health care facility named in the Conrad 30 waiver application and H-1B petition due to extenuating circumstances. Examples of extenuating circumstances include closure of the health care facility or hardship to the noncitizen. In determining whether to excuse such early termination of employment, USCIS will base its decision on the specific facts of each case. In all cases, the burden to establish eligibility for a favorable exercise of discretion rests with the H-1B foreign medical graduate.\\nAnother health care facility may seek to employ such a waiver recipient (before the time the recipient has completed his or her 3-year contract named in the waiver application and the original H-1B petition) by filing a new H-1B petition with USCIS. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(D) and (E). Although the state public health department does not need to file a new waiver application with DOS, the new H-1B petition must be accompanied by the documentary evidence generally required under 8 CFR 214.2(h), including:\\nAn explanation from the waiver recipient, with supporting evidence, establishing that extenuating circumstances necessitate a change of employment\\nEvidence that the geographic area or areas of intended employment have been designated by HHS as a HPSA, MUA, or MUP, or in some cases, that the waiver recipient will be serving patients in such an area.\\n\\nThe new H-1B petition will not be approved unless USCIS determines that the waiver recipient has established the existence of extenuating circumstances that excuse early termination of employment as stated in the terms and conditions in the original H-1B petition.\\nQ4. Can the recipient of a Conrad waiver who is in H-1B status begin employment at a new health care facility after the extenuating circumstances H-1B petition is filed and while it is pending?\\nA4. Yes. The waiver recipient may begin employment with the new employer after the new H-1B petition is filed and while it is pending. However, if the new petition is denied, employment authorization will cease and the waiver recipient will become subject to the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the INA unless they are the beneficiary of another H1-B petition with current validity dates for employment at a qualifying healthcare facility.Q5. What are the reporting requirements for the health care facility named in the waiver application and H-1B petition if the waiver recipient fails to fulfill the 3-year employment contract, or if he or she changes employers?\\nA5. If the health care facility no longer employs the waiver recipient, the health care facility must immediately send a letter explaining the changes in the terms and conditions of employment of the waiver recipient to the Service Center that approved the I-129 petition, as is required, under 8 CFR 214.2(h)(11)(i)(A).\\nQ6. Can the spouse and/or child of a waiver recipient who has not yet fulfilled the terms and conditions of the Conrad 30 waiver independently apply for waiver of the 2-year foreign residence requirement?\\nA6. According to the DOS website, the spouse and/or child of a waiver recipient can independently apply for a waiver only if the principal waiver recipient has died, the spouse has divorced the principal waiver recipient, or if the child is over age 21. Note that if the J-2 spouse/child was also a J-1 at some point in the past, they may, if qualified, seek a waiver for themselves, independent of their spouse/parent.\\nQ7. How does a Conrad 30 waiver recipient (or some other concerned individual) report wage and labor related abuse?\\nA7. The Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is responsible for enforcing worker protections in certain temporary worker programs including the H-1B program. For information pertaining to how you can report wage and labor related abuse, please see Department of Labor’s WHD webpage\\nBackground on J-1 medical status\\nA J-1 exchange visitor who came to the United States or acquired such status in order to receive graduate medical education or training (a J-1 foreign medical graduate) is generally ineligible to apply for:\\nAn immigrant visa\\nAdjustment of Status\\nAn H or L nonimmigrant visa\\n\\nTo be eligible to do so, a J-1 exchange visitor must have resided and been physically present in his or her country of nationality or last residence for at least 2 years (the 2-year foreign residence requirement) upon completion of the J-1 exchange visitor program. Any spouse or child admitted as an accompanying J-2 status holder is also subject to the 2-year foreign residence requirement. See section 212(e) of the INA.\\nA J-1 foreign medical graduate (and his or her J-2 spouse and/or child) is ineligible to change from J nonimmigrant status to any other nonimmigrant status (except in certain cases to A, G, T, or U).

Eligible students can apply to receive up to 12 months of OPT employment authorization before completing their academic studies (pre-completion) and/or after completing their academic studies (post-completion). However, all periods of pre-completion OPT will be deducted from the available period of post-completion OPT.\\nAll OPT must be directly related to your major area of study. If you are an F-1 student, you may be eligible to participate in OPT in two different ways:\\nPre-completion OPT: You may apply to participate in pre-completion OPT after you have been lawfully enrolled on a full-time basis for one full academic year at a college, university, conservatory, or seminary that has been certified by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) to enroll F-1 students.\\xa0You do not need to have had F-1 status for the one full academic year; you can satisfy the “one full academic year” requirement even if you had another nonimmigrant status during that time.\\n\\nIf you are authorized to participate in pre-completion OPT, you may work (20 hours or less per week) while school is in session. You may work full time when school is not in session.\\nPost-completion OPT: You may apply to participate in post-completion OPT after completing your studies.

In addition, you must show that you will continue working in your area of extraordinary ability and that your work will substantially benefit the United States in the future. Extraordinary ability means that your level of expertise indicates that you are one of the small percentage of individuals who have risen to the very top of your field. You may self-petition as an extraordinary ability individual, because a job offer is not required for this classification.\\n    \\nRequirement 1- You must be able to establish that you have extraordinary ability in your field.\\n\\nThe EB-1A extraordinary ability classification is for people who are recognized as being at the very top of their field and who are coming to (or remaining in) the United States to continue work in that field.

This category generally requires a job offer and a labor certification issued by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) before an employer could move on to the next step of filing an immigrant visa petition with USCIS and (if approved) before a beneficiary could be issued an immigrant visa through adjustment or consular processing. Please visit DOL’s website to learn more about the\\xa0labor certification process.\\n    \\nDOL regulations generally prohibit the issuance of labor certifications in self-employment scenarios. However, an entrepreneur seeking EB-2 classification and a National Interest Waiver (NIW) may self-petition and not be subject to the labor certification requirement. Accordingly, one option for entrepreneurs includes filing an EB-2 visa petition if they can qualify for an NIW, which exempts them from the job offer requirement and, thus, the labor certification requirement.\\n    \\nIf you are requesting a NIW, you must first demonstrate that you are either a member of the professions holding an advanced degree or an individual of exceptional ability.\\n    \\nAdvanced Degree Professionals\\n\\nRequirement 1 – You must show that you have a U.S. advanced degree or foreign equivalent degree.\\n\\nAn \"advanced degree” is an academic or professional degree above a bachelor’s degree.\\xa0 Some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate that you have an advanced degree may include:\\n    \\nCopies of official transcripts;\\nCertified copies of the actual degree, diploma, certificate, or similar award;\\nAny other official documentation from the school’s Office of the Registrar;\\nAn evaluation from an educational evaluation agency, if you obtained your degree outside the United States; and\\nIf you only have a U.S. bachelor’s degree (or foreign equivalent degree), letters from your current and/or prior employers showing at least 5 years of progressively responsible experience in your field after you received the degree.\\n\\nThe USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance on how we determine eligibility for advanced degree professionals.\\n    \\nRequirement 2 – Your advanced degree must be related to the field in which you will be working.\\n\\nSome of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate that your advanced degree relates to your field includes, but is not limited to:\\n    \\nA letter from you or your prospective employer describing your current or proposed job;\\nDocuments describing your company and its work; and\\nA copy of your company’s annual report, if one is issued.\\n\\nExceptional Ability\\n\\nRequirement 1 – You must show that you have exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business.\\n\\nTo qualify for the EB-2 exceptional ability classification, you must show that you have exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business. The initial evidence must include at least three of the six types of evidence listed below. If you meet the minimum threshold requirements, USCIS will then evaluate all the evidence you submitted in its totality to determine whether you have a degree of expertise significantly above that normally encountered in the sciences, arts, or business. You must answer yes and submit evidence for at least three of the six questions below:\\n    \\nHave you received a degree, diploma, certificate or similar award from a college, university, school or other institution, relating to the field of exceptional ability?\\nDo you have at least 10 years of full-time experience in your field?\\nIf required, do you have a license or certification to practice in your profession or occupation?\\nHave you or will you command a high salary or other remuneration for your services, which demonstrates your exceptional ability?\\nAre you a member of professional associations?\\nHave you been recognized for achievements and significant contributions to your industry or field?\\n\\nNote: If any of the criteria discussed in this section do not readily apply to your occupation, you may submit comparable evidence to establish your eligibility.\\n    \\nIf you meet these minimum threshold requirements, USCIS will then evaluate all the evidence you submitted in its totality to determine whether you have a degree of expertise significantly above that normally encountered in the sciences, arts, or business.\\n    \\nThe USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance on how we determine eligibility for exceptional ability classification.\\n    \\nRequirement 2 – You must show that you will substantially benefit prospectively the U.S. economy, U.S. cultural interests, U.S. educational interests, or U.S. welfare.\\n\\nA prospective benefit is generally shown by documenting a past record of achievements and explaining how that indicates your future success.\\n    \\nSome of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate how you will substantially benefit the United States prospectively includes, but is not limited to:\\n    \\nDocuments showing how your past accomplishments benefit the United States as a whole and specifying which element(s) (national economy, cultural or educational interest, or welfare of the United States) your entrepreneurial enterprise will benefit;\\nCopies of awards or any special recognition you may have received, with details about the criteria used to grant the award or recognition;\\nPublished reports about your successes;\\nLetters from current or former employers documenting your prior work experience, to include information about your accomplishments and their significance, and how these accomplishments benefit the United States;\\nLetters from experts in your field regarding your accomplishments and their significance, including how your work will prospectively benefit the United States; and\\nEvidence of past achievements should be accompanied with documentation or explanations of how these accomplishments indicate future or continued success.\\n\\nNational Interest Waiver\\n\\nUSCIS may, as a matter of discretion, grant your request for a National Interest Waiver where the below requirements are met:\\n    \\nYour proposed endeavor has both substantial merit and national importance.\\nYou are well-positioned to advance the proposed endeavor.\\nOn balance, it would be beneficial to the United States to waive the requirements of a job offer, and thus the labor certification.\\n\\nThe USCIS Policy Manual includes\\xa0detailed guidance on how we evaluate eligibility for national interest waivers based on the above requirements, and it also includes a discussion of\\xa0specific evidentiary considerations for entrepreneurs. For example, there may be unique aspects of evidence submitted by an entrepreneurial petitioner\\xa0undertaking a proposed endeavor, including through an entity based in the United States in which the petitioner typically possesses (or will possess) an ownership interest, and in which the petitioner maintains (or will maintain) an active and central role such that the petitioner’s knowledge, skills, or experience would significantly advance the proposed endeavor.\\n    \\nUSCIS considers that entrepreneurs do not follow traditional career paths and start-ups vary in structure. In addition to the general guidance, the USCIS Policy Manual clarifies that as an entrepreneur petitioner, you may submit other types of evidence to establish that your endeavor has substantial merit and national importance, that you are well positioned to advance the endeavor, and that, on balance, it would be beneficial to waive the job offer and thus labor certification requirements.\\n    \\nEB-5 – Immigrant Investor Program\\n  \\nCongress created the EB-5 program to stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors.

This guide also highlights some of the most important immigration-related considerations for entrepreneurs contemplating starting or managing a business in the United States.\\nMore information is available on uscis.gov for temporary and permanent pathways as well as for the International Entrepreneur Rule and Optional Practical Training (OPT) for F-1 students. In addition, the Working in the United States section of uscis.gov provides a general guide to employment in the United States. You may wish to consult with an attorney to determine the best option for you.\\nKey Questions to Consider When Choosing an Entrepreneur Pathway\\nAm I required to make an investment or have an ownership interest in the start-up?\\nSome pathways, such as the International Entrepreneur Rule, require you to have a certain amount of ownership in the start-up entity. Other pathways, such as E-2 Treaty Investor or EB-5 Immigrant Investor, require you invest. For some pathways, you may be an owner or investor, but it is not required.\\nAm I required to have a certain role or position in the start-up entity?\\nSome pathways require that you have a certain role or position in the start-up entity. The International Entrepreneur Rule requires you to have a central and active role in operations. E-2 requires you to have the capacity to develop and direct the enterprise. L-1A Intracompany Transferee Executive or Manager requires you to be in a managerial or executive position. H-1B Specialty Occupation requires you to work in a specialty occupation related to your degree. Other pathways, such as the O-1A nonimmigrant classification or the EB-1A first-preference immigrant visa classification, are for individuals with extraordinary ability and require you to continue to work in your field of expertise. Additional pathways are discussed in detail below.\\nWhat are the requirements for the start-up entity?\\nSome pathways have requirements for the start-up entity. For example, the International Entrepreneur Rule requires the entity to lawfully conduct business in the United States and to have been formed within the five years immediately preceding the initial application. It must also have substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation. The L-1 nonimmigrant visa classification requires the new office to have a qualifying relationship (parent, subsidiary, or affiliate) with a foreign business that employed you abroad for at least one year. Additional requirements are discussed in detail below.\\nDo I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?\\nSome pathways, such as the O-1A nonimmigrant visa classification and the EB-1A immigrant visa classification, are for those with “extraordinary ability.” These require that a person have sustained national or international acclaim in their field of expertise. Others, such as the H-1B, require at least a U.S. bachelor’s degree in a specific specialty or its equivalent related to the position.\\nWill I be working in the United States on a permanent basis as a lawful permanent resident, or will I be working on a temporary basis as a parolee or nonimmigrant?\\nSome opportunities provide a basis for individuals to obtain lawful permanent resident status in the United States. Permanent resident status allows you to live and work in the United States permanently, and typically provides you with a path to U.S. citizenship. These opportunities are known as “immigrant” pathways.\\nOther pathways, such as parole or nonimmigrant status, allow you to temporarily live and work in the United States. Although some of these nonimmigrant pathways cannot be extended indefinitely, they can provide more time to demonstrate eligibility for a permanent resident pathway.\\nNonimmigrant or Parole (Temporary) Pathways\\nFor more details, see our Nonimmigrant or Parole (Temporary) Pathways for Entrepreneur Employment in the United States page.\\nIER\\nThe start-up business must be organized and lawfully conduct business in the United States and be formed within the five years immediately preceding your initial application.

Moreover, the employer that signs the Form I-983 must be the same entity that provides the practical training experience to the student.\\nAn employer must have sufficient resources and trained or supervisory personnel available to provide appropriate training in connection with the specified training opportunity at the location(s) where the student’s practical training experience will take place, as specified in the Form I-983. The “personnel” who may provide and supervise the training experience may be either employees of the employer, or contractors who the employer has directly retained to provide services to the employer; they may not, however, be employees or contractors of the employer’s clients or customers. Additionally, under no circumstances would another F-1 student with OPT or a STEM OPT extension (who is undergoing training in their own right) be qualified to train another F-1 student with a STEM OPT extension.\\nWhile employers may rely on their existing training programs or policies to satisfy the requirements relating to performance evaluation and oversight and supervision, the student’s Training Plan must nevertheless be customized for the individual student. For instance, every Training Plan must describe the direct relationship between the STEM OPT opportunity and the student’s qualifying STEM degree, as well as the relationship between the STEM OPT opportunity and the student’s goals and objectives for work-based learning. Moreover, a STEM OPT employer may not assign, or otherwise delegate, its training responsibilities to a non-employer third party (e.g., a client/customer of the employer, employees of the client/customer, or contractors of the client/customer).\\nAs noted above, DHS, at its discretion, may conduct a site visit of any STEM OPT employer to ensure that the employer possesses and maintains the ability and resources to provide structured and guided work-based learning experiences consistent with the Form I-983. See 8 C.F.R. 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C)(11). Consistent with this provision, during a site visit, DHS may verify that the employer that signs the Form I-983 is the same entity that provides the practical training experience to the student and ensure compliance.\\xa0For ICE to effectively conduct these site visits as part of its oversight responsibilities, it is important that employers report any change in a student’s employment address. As indicated above, the employer and student must report such a material change by submitting a modified Form I-983 to the DSO at the earliest available opportunity.\\nThe Employer’s Training Obligation: Staffing and Temporary Agencies\\nStaffing and temporary agencies and consulting firms may seek to employ students under the STEM OPT program, but only if they will be the entity that provides the practical training experience to the student and they have and maintain a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student. STEM OPT participants may engage in a training experience that takes place at a site other than the employer’s principal place of business as long as all of the training obligations are met, including that the employer has and maintains a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student.\\xa0Certain types of arrangements, including multiple employer arrangements, sole proprietorships, employment through ‘‘temp’’ agencies, employment through consulting firm arrangements that provide labor for hire, and other similar relationships may not be able to demonstrate a bona fide employer-employee relationship and, therefore, may not meet the requirements of the STEM OPT extension.\\nAs part of the STEM OPT extension, employers must complete the appropriate parts of Form I-983, Training Plan for STEM OPT Students. In this form,\\xa0employers attest that:\\nThey have enough resources and trained personnel available to appropriately train the student;\\nThe student will not replace a full- or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. worker; and\\nWorking for them will help the student attain their training objectives.\\n\\nDHS will review on a case-by-case basis whether the student will be a bona fide employee of the employer signing the training plan, and verify that the employer that signs the training plan is the same entity that employs the student and provides the practical training experience.\\nFor more information, please refer to the\\xa0DHS STEM OPT Hub.', \"\\n中文 (PDF, 250.08 KB)\\xa0 | 한국어 (PDF, 428.48 KB)\\xa0 | Русский (PDF, 361.57 KB)\\nImmigrant pathways offer opportunities to work in the United States for a range of reasons on a more permanent basis. They provide lawful permanent residence (Green Card), which can eventually lead to U.S. citizenship.\\nThe lawful permanent resident process involves two or three steps, depending on the employment-based immigrant visa classification sought. In general, most petitioners (typically employers) filing EB-2 and EB-3 petitions must take the first step of filing an Application for Permanent Employment Certification (ETA Form 9089  (PDF)), commonly known as a labor certification, with the Department of Labor (DOL). An approved permanent labor certification application demonstrates that:\\nThe petitioner tested the labor market in the geographic area where the permanent job offer is located to establish that there are no able, qualified, and available U.S. workers who are willing to accept the permanent job offer; and\\nThe employment of the beneficiary will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.\\n\\nAfter certification from DOL, the petitioner submits the certified labor certification with an immigrant visa petition to USCIS. In all cases, the process requires the two steps of filing of an immigrant petition with USCIS and either an adjustment application with USCIS (if you are in the United States) or an immigrant visa application with the Department of State (DOS) (if you are outside the United States or not pursuing adjustment of status).\\nAn approved immigrant visa petition secures your priority date that will determine the order of immigrant visa availability. You may only file an adjustment application or request a visa through a consulate once an immigrant visa is immediately available. If an immigrant visa is immediately available when you or your sponsoring employer files the petition with USCIS, you may file your adjustment application at the same time. You are eligible to apply for work authorization concurrently with your adjustment application and while your adjustment application is pending.\\nThe availability of an immigrant visa will depend on the employment-based classification being sought (typically the availability is greater for the higher preferences), and the immigrant’s country of chargeability (usually the country of birth).\\nAs a general matter, EB-1 immigrant visas tend to be immediately available to any qualifying applicant, regardless of country of origin. For EB-2 and EB-3 immigrant visas, however, there is typically a queue for nationals of China and India.\\nThe USCIS webpage Visa Availability and Priority Dates and Consular Processing provides information about the DOS Visa Bulletin process and explain how DOS allocates immigrant visas and consular processing generally.\\nEB-1A Extraordinary Ability\\nPersons of extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics may self-petition to enter the United States permanently to continue working in their area of extraordinary ability.\\nYou may be eligible for the EB-1A extraordinary ability immigrant visa classification if you have extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics as demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim and recognized achievements in your field of expertise. In addition, you must show that you will continue working in your area of extraordinary ability. Extraordinary ability means that your level of expertise indicates that you are one of the small percentage of individuals who have risen to the very top of your field.\\nDo I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?\\nYou must be able to establish that you have extraordinary ability in your field.\\nThe EB-1A extraordinary ability classification is for people who are recognized as being at the very top of their field and who are coming to the United States to continue work in that field. To establish eligibility, you must demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and that your achievements, including STEM achievements, have been recognized in your field by showing: (1) that you have received a major internationally recognized award, similar to a Nobel Prize; or, more commonly, (2) that you meet at least 3 of the 10 requirements listed below and all your evidence, when evaluated together, shows that you are among the small percentage of individuals that have risen to the very top of your field. If you have not received a major internationally recognized award, you must submit evidence that, more likely than not, affirmatively answers at least 3 of the 10 questions below:\\nHave you received any lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor?\\nAre you, or have you been, a member of an association that requires outstanding achievements of its members as judged by recognized national or international experts?\\nIs there published material in professional or major trade publications or major media about you that relates to your work in the field?\\nHave you participated on a panel or individually as a judge of the work of others in the same or in an allied field of specialization?\\nHave you made an original scientific, scholarly, or business-related contribution to the field that is of major significance?\\nHave you authored any scholarly articles in professional journals or other major media?\\nHas your work been displayed at an artistic exhibition or showcase?\\nHave you played a leading or critical role for an organization with a distinguished reputation?\\nHave you commanded a high salary or other remuneration for your services in comparison to others in your field?\\nHave you enjoyed commercial successes in the performing arts?\\n\\nNote: If the criteria discussed in this section do not readily apply to your occupation, you may submit comparable evidence to establish your eligibility. However, there is no comparable evidence for the one-time achievement of a major, internationally recognized award.\\nIf you meet these minimum threshold requirements, USCIS will then evaluate all the evidence you submitted in its totality to determine whether you have sustained national or international acclaim and recognized achievements in your field of expertise and that you are one of the small percentage of individuals who have risen to the very top of your field.\\nThe USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance regarding how EB-1A eligibility is evaluated, including an appendix chart that describes considerations that are relevant to evaluating evidence under each of the above criteria and evaluating comparable evidence.\\nDo I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?\\nYou do not need to have a job offer – but you must be able to establish that you are coming to the United States to continue to work in your area of extraordinary ability. You may submit the petition yourself directly to USCIS, or a company may file a petition on your behalf.\\nSome of the evidence typically submitted to demonstrate that a person is coming to the United States to continue to work in your area of extraordinary ability includes:\\nLetters from current or prospective employers,\\nDocuments evidencing your prearranged commitments (such as contracts), or\\nA statement detailing your plans on how you intend to continue working in your field in the United States.\\n\\nWill I be working in the United States on a permanent (no time limit) basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?\\nYou will be working in the United States on a permanent basis if you are granted lawful permanent resident status.\\nEB-1B Outstanding Professors and Researchers\\nProfessors and researchers who are internationally recognized as outstanding may be eligible to come to the United States permanently to work for an institution of higher education or private employer when the prospective employer files a petition on their behalf.\\nYou may be eligible for EB-1B classification as an outstanding professor or researcher if you are internationally recognized for your outstanding achievements in a particular academic field. You must have at least 3 years of experience in teaching or research in that academic area. You must also be entering the United States to pursue a tenure or tenure track teaching or comparable research position at a university, institution of higher education, or private employer.\\nDo I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?\\nYou must be able to establish that you are recognized internationally as outstanding in the academic field specified in the petition.\\nTo establish eligibility for an EB-1B visa, your sponsoring employer must submit documentation that you have at least 3 years of experience in teaching or research in the academic field. The 3 years of experience may include teaching or research while pursuing your advanced degree if you received that degree and, for teaching, if you had full responsibility for the class or the research was recognized within the academic field as outstanding. You must also submit evidence that, more likely than not, affirmatively answers at least 2 of the 6 questions below:\\nHave you received a major prize or award for outstanding achievement?\\nAre you, or have you been, a member of an association that requires outstanding achievements of its members?\\nIs there published material in professional publications about your work in the academic field?\\nHave you participated on a panel or individually as a judge of the work of others in the same or in an allied academic field?\\nHave you made original scientific or scholarly contributions in the field?\\nHave you authored scholarly books or articles (in scholarly journals with international circulation) in the academic field?\\n\\nNote: If any of the criteria discussed in this section do not readily apply, your sponsoring employer may submit comparable evidence to establish your eligibility.\\nIf you meet these minimum threshold requirements, USCIS will then evaluate all the evidence you submitted in its totality to determine whether you are recognized internationally as outstanding in your academic field.\\nThe USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance regarding EB-1B eligibility, including an appendix chart that describes considerations that are relevant to evaluating evidence under each of the above criteria and evaluating comparable evidence.\\nDo I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?\\nYou must have a job offer from a United States employer that is a university, institution of higher learning, or private employer that employs at least 3 persons full-time in research positions. That same employer must file a petition for you, but because no labor certification is required, the employer does not have to apply through the Department of Labor before filing with USCIS. The job offer must be in the form of a letter that offers you a tenure or tenure track position or a permanent research position.\\nWill I be working in the United States on a permanent (no time limit) basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?\\nYou will be working in the United States on a permanent basis if you are granted lawful permanent resident status.\\nEB-1C Multinational Managers and Executives\\nCertain managers and executives with experience working abroad for a multinational company may be eligible to come work permanently in the United States for a U.S. company with a qualifying relationship to the company abroad.\\nYou may be eligible for EB-1C classification if you a have a permanent job offer in a primarily managerial or executive position with a qualifying U.S. employer that has been doing business for at least 1 year and you have been employed for at least 1 year by a related organization abroad to work in a capacity that is managerial or executive. While you need a sponsoring employer, because no labor certification is required, the employer does not have to apply through the Department of Labor before filing with USCIS.\\nDo I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?\\nYou must have at least 1 year of qualifying experience.\\nTo establish EB-1C eligibility, you must have been employed, in a primarily executive or managerial capacity, outside the United States for at least 1 year in the 3 years immediately preceding the filing of the petition or the most recent lawful nonimmigrant admission if you are already in the United States.\\nDo I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?\\nYou must have a job offer to work in a primarily managerial or executive position for a United States employer that has a qualifying relationship with your foreign employer. The U.S. employer must file a petition for you.\\nA qualifying relationship\\nA qualifying relationship exists when the U.S. employer is an affiliate, parent, or subsidiary of the foreign firm, corporation, or other legal entity. To establish a qualifying relationship under the statute and the regulations, the petitioner must show that the beneficiary's foreign employer and the proposed U.S. employer are the same employer (for example, a U.S. entity with a foreign office) or related as a parent and subsidiary or as affiliates.\\nBoth the U.S. employer and at least one qualifying organization abroad must continue to do business up until the time of visa issuance or adjustment of status, and the U.S. employer must have been actively engaged in doing business for at least 1 year at the time of filing of the petition.\\nA qualifying position\\nTo qualify for EB-1C classification, you must be coming to the United States to work in a primarily managerial or executive position with a qualifying U.S. employer. Managerial capacity includes personnel and function manager positions that manage, supervise and control certain personnel or organizational functions while executive capacity includes executive positions that direct management, establish goals and policies, and exercise wide latitude in discretionary decision making within an organization.\\nWill I be working in the United States on a permanent (no time limit) basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?\\nYou will be working in the United States on a permanent basis if you are granted lawful permanent resident status.\\nEB-2 Advanced Degree Professionals and Persons of Exceptional Ability\\nA professional with an advanced degree or a person of exceptional ability may enter the United States to work for a petitioning employer or, if self-petitioning, in a proposed endeavor by requesting a waiver of the labor certification process in the national interest.\\nThe EB-2 classification is divided into two sub-categories: professionals with advanced degrees and individuals with exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business. Although a job offer from an employer and a labor certification from the Department of Labor are generally required for the EB-2 classification, you may be eligible to self-petition if you are asking for a waiver of the labor certification requirement based on the national interest. This self-petition, which does not require a sponsoring employer and skips the labor certification process, is known as a national interest waiver.\\nNote: The labor certification process confirms that there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, qualified, and available to accept the job opportunity in the area of intended employment and that employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. More information on the labor certification process is available in the USCIS Policy Manual, and on the Department of Labor’s website.\\nIf you are requesting a waiver of the job offer (and thus, the labor certification) because it is in the national interest of the United States, you are eligible to file a petition on your own behalf, and you may do so whether you seek to classify yourself as a member of a profession who has an advanced degree or as an individual of exceptional ability.\\nDo I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?\\nWe will review all the evidence you submit to determine whether you are eligible for the employment based second preference classification and, if requested, whether it is in the national interest of the United States to grant a discretionary waiver of the job offer and labor certification requirement.\\nEmployment Based Second Preference: EB-2 Classification - General Requirements\\nYou must be a professional with an advanced degree or a person with exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business. You are generally required to have a job offer and a labor certification from the Department of Labor.\\nRequirements for Advanced Degree Professional Classification\\nTo qualify for classification as an advanced degree professional, you must be a member of the professions holding an advanced degree or foreign equivalent degree, and the position certified in the underlying labor certification must require, at a minimum, a professional holding such a degree (a bachelor’s followed by at least 5 years of progressively responsible experience is considered the equivalent of an advanced degree).\\nYou will need to provide documentation, such as an official academic record showing that you have a U.S. advanced degree or a foreign equivalent degree, or an official academic record showing that you have a U.S. bachelor’s degree or a foreign equivalent degree and letters from current or former employers showing that you have at least 5 years of progressive post-bachelor’s work experience in the specialty. If a doctoral degree is customarily required by the specialty, you must have a U.S. doctorate or foreign equivalent degree.\\nThe USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance on how we determine eligibility for advanced degree professionals.\\nRequirements for Exceptional Ability Classification\\nTo qualify for the EB-2 exceptional ability classification, you must show that you have exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business. Your initial evidence must include evidence that affirmatively answers at least 3 of the 6 questions below:\\nHave you received a degree, diploma, certificate or similar award from a college, university, school, or other institution, relating to the field of exceptional ability?\\nDo you have at least 10 years of full-time experience in your field, as demonstrated by letters from current or former employers?\\nDo you have a license or certification to practice in your profession or occupation?\\nHave you commanded a high salary or other remuneration for your services, which demonstrates your exceptional ability?\\nAre you a member of any professional associations?\\nHave you been recognized for any achievements and significant contributions to the industry by peers, governmental entities, or professional or business organizations?\\n\\nNote: If any of the criteria discussed in this section do not readily apply to your occupation, you may submit comparable evidence to establish your eligibility.\\nIf you meet these minimum threshold requirements, USCIS will then evaluate all the evidence you submitted in its totality to determine whether you have a degree of expertise significantly above that normally encountered in the sciences, arts, or business.\\nThe USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance on how we determine eligibility for exceptional ability classification.\\nDo I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?\\nThe EB-2 classification normally requires a job offer from a U.S. employer. In general, the U.S. employer first obtains a labor certification approval from the Department of Labor and then files a petition on your behalf with USCIS.\\nFor nurses who may qualify under EB-2, and physical therapists, a labor certification from the Department of Labor is not required. Instead, the petition is submitted with an uncertified ETA Form 9089 for consideration as Schedule A, Group I occupation. More information on Schedule A, Group I is available in the USCIS Policy Manual.\\nYou may seek a waiver of the job offer (and thus the labor certification requirement) and petition for yourself with no U.S. employer if you can establish that it is in the national interest to waive the job offer requirement.\\nNational Interest Waiver Requirements\\nUSCIS may, as a matter of discretion, grant your request for a national interest waiver where the below requirements are met:\\nYour proposed endeavor has both substantial merit and national importance.\\nYou are well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor.\\nOn balance, it would be beneficial to the United States to waive the requirements of a job offer, and thus the labor certification.\\n\\nThe USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance on how we evaluate eligibility for national interest waivers based on the above requirements, and it also includes a discussion of specific evidentiary considerations for those well positioned to advance STEM endeavors. For example, the USCIS Policy Manual explains how an advanced degree in a STEM field tied to a proposed endeavor in a critical and emerging technology or supports U.S. national security or economic competitiveness is a strong positive factor, as are letters from interested government agencies.\\nCritical and emerging technologies are those that are critical to U.S. national security, including military defense and the economy. To identify a critical and emerging technology field, USCIS considers governmental, academic, and other authoritative and instructive sources, and all other evidence submitted by the petitioner. The lists of critical and emerging technology subfields published by the Executive Office of the President, by either the National Science and Technology Council or the National Security Council, are examples of authoritative lists. For example, the National Science and Technology Council’s\\xa0Critical and Emerging Technologies List Update  (PDF)\\xa0(February 2022) identifies critical and emerging technologies “with the potential to further these [national security] objectives,” meaning security of Americans, economic prosperity, or democratic values. Departments and agencies may consult this list “when developing, for example, initiatives to research and develop technologies that support national security missions, compete for international talent, and protect sensitive technology from misappropriation and misuse.” The list is part of\\xa0A Report by the Fast Track Action Subcommittee on Critical and Emerging Technologies.\\nA STEM area is important to competitiveness or security in a variety of circumstances. For example, when the evidence in the record demonstrates that an endeavor will help the United States to remain ahead of strategic competitors or current and potential adversaries, or relates to a field, including those that are research and development-intensive industries. One, but certainly not the only, indicator of STEM areas important to U.S. competitiveness is inclusion as a priority in the annual research and development priorities memo about the President’s budget issued jointly by the White House Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. For example, the\\xa0Memorandum on Research and Development Priorities  (PDF)\\xa0(August 2021) for President Biden’s FY2022 budget is indicative of STEM areas important to U.S. competitiveness. U.S. national security objectives are outlined in the\\xa0Interim National Security Strategic Guidance  (PDF). These objectives include: protect the security of the American people; expand economic prosperity and opportunity; and realize and defend democratic values. For purposes of national interest waiver policy and adjudications, “national security” refers to these three objectives.\\nMany proposed endeavors that aim to advance STEM technologies and research, whether in academic or industry settings, not only have substantial merit in relation to U.S. science and technology interests, but also have sufficiently broad potential implications to demonstrate national importance. On the other hand, while proposed classroom teaching activities in STEM, for example, may have substantial merit in relation to U.S. educational interests, such activities, by themselves, generally are not indicative of an impact in the field of STEM education more broadly, and therefore generally would not establish their national importance.\\nUSCIS considers an advanced degree, particularly a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), in a STEM field tied to the proposed endeavor and related to work furthering a critical and emerging technology or other STEM area important to U.S. competitiveness or national security, an especially positive factor to be considered along with other evidence for purposes of the assessment under the second prong.\\nWhen evaluating the third prong and whether the United States may benefit from the person’s entry, regardless of whether other U.S. workers are available (as well as other factors relating to prong three discussed above, such as urgency), USCIS considers the following combination of facts contained in the record to be a strong positive factor:\\nThe person possesses an advanced STEM degree, particularly a Ph.D.;\\nThe person will be engaged in work furthering a critical and emerging technology or other STEM area important to U.S. competitiveness; and\\nThe person is well positioned to advance the proposed STEM endeavor of national importance.\\n\\nThe benefit is given particular weight where the endeavor has the potential to support U.S. national security or enhance U.S. economic competitiveness, or when the petition is supported by letters from interested U.S. government agencies.\\nWill I be working in the United States on a permanent (no time limit) basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?\\nYou will be working in the United States on a permanent basis if you are granted lawful permanent resident status.\\nEB-3 Skilled Workers, Professionals, and Other (Unskilled) Workers\\nSkilled workers, professionals, and other workers may be eligible to permanently work in the United States if petitioned by a sponsoring U.S. employer.\\n“Skilled workers” are persons whose jobs require a minimum of 2 years’ training or experience (including in STEM fields). The skilled worker must meet the educational, training, or experience requirements of the job opportunity as listed on the labor certification. Relevant post-secondary education, such as an associate’s degree in telecommunications technology, may be considered as training.\\n“Professionals” are persons whose job requires at least a U.S. bachelor’s or foreign equivalent degree and are a member of the professions.\\n“Other workers” are persons whose jobs require less than 2 years’ training or experience. The other worker must meet the educational, training, or experience requirements of the job opportunity as listed on the labor certification.\\xa0 Because STEM occupations generally do not fall under the other worker classification, it is not further addressed in this guide.\\nDo I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?\\nYou must have at least 2 years of experience or training (relevant post-secondary education may be considered as training) to qualify as a skilled worker. You must have at least a U.S. bachelor’s degree (or a foreign equivalent degree) to qualify as a professional. While a foreign degree that is not equivalent to a U.S. bachelor’s degree will not qualify you for classification as a professional, it may still qualify you as a skilled worker.\\nThe USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance on how we determine eligibility for skilled workers, professionals, and other workers.\\nDo I need to have a job offer?\\xa0 Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?\\nThird preference petitions must be filed by a sponsoring employer, and must generally be accompanied by an approved labor certification from the Department of Labor on ETA Form 9089  (PDF). For nurses and physical therapists who may still qualify under EB-3, the petition is submitted directly to USCIS with an uncertified ETA Form 9089 for consideration as Schedule A, Group I occupation. More information on Schedule A, Group I is in the USCIS Policy Manual.\\nMore information on the labor certification process is available in the USCIS Policy Manual, and on the Department of Labor website.\\nWill I be working in the United States on a permanent (no time limit) basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?\\nYou will be working in the United States on a permanent basis if you are granted lawful permanent resident status.\", '\\n中文 (PDF, 253.39 KB)\\xa0 | 한국어 (PDF, 322.1 KB)\\xa0 | Русский (PDF, 280.01 KB)\\nThe United States has long been a destination for top talent from all over the world. Our ability to attract global talent—especially in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)—has spurred path-breaking innovation, leading to the creation of jobs, new industries, and new opportunities for all Americans.\\nThis online resource provides an overview of some of the temporary and permanent pathways for noncitizens to work in the United States in STEM fields. This guide also highlights some of the most important considerations for STEM professionals contemplating working in the United States. Subsequent sections outline these pathways in more detail. \\xa0\\nMore information on how to apply is available on uscis.gov for both temporary and permanent pathways as well as for optional practical training for students. In addition, a general guide to employment in the United States can be found in the Working in the United States section of uscis.gov. You may wish to consult with an attorney to evaluate the best classification for you.\\nKey Questions to Consider When Choosing a STEM Pathway\\nDo I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?\\nSome pathways, such as the O-1 nonimmigrant visa classification and the EB-1A immigrant visa classification, are for those with “extraordinary ability.” These require that a person have widespread and sustained acclaim. Others, such as the H-1B, require at least a relevant bachelor’s degree or equivalent. And others, such as the L-1, require a pre-existing relationship with a company that does business both in the United States and abroad.\\xa0\\nDo I need to have a job offer?\\xa0 Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?\\nMost pathways require you to already have a job offer, in which case an employer will submit a petition to USCIS on your behalf. However, some classifications do not require a job offer and permit you to directly submit an application or petition with USCIS (“self-petitioning”). For example, if you are seeking lawful permanent resident status (a Green Card) based on a classification as an individual with “extraordinary ability” (the EB-1A category), you do not need a job offer and do not need an employer to file the immigrant petition on your behalf (meaning, you may self-petition). Although a job offer is not required in this example, you must provide evidence establishing that you are coming to the United States to continue work in your area of expertise.\\nWill I be working in the United States on a permanent basis as a lawful permanent resident, or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant?\\nSome opportunities provide a basis for individuals, including STEM professionals, to obtain permanent resident status in the United States. Permanent resident status allows you to live and work in the United States permanently, and typically provides you with a path to citizenship. These opportunities are known as “immigrant” pathways.\\nOthers (for example, F-1 OPT, H-1B, L-1 and O-1), also known as “nonimmigrant” pathways, allow you to temporarily live and work in the United States. Many people who do work through one of these nonimmigrant pathways eventually transition to permanent resident pathways, and eventually U.S. citizenship.\\nAre there any other criteria that are required for a specific pathway?\\nSome criteria that are not directly related to professional qualifications can affect visa eligibility. For instance, only citizens of Canada and Mexico qualify for TN visas. In addition, there can be some timing or other requirements particular to certain pathways. For example, some immigrant pathways require the employer to first obtain an approved labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor.

       "'Optional Practical Training Extension for STEM Students (STEM OPT) | USCIS\\nCertain F-1 students who receive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees may apply for a 24-month extension of their post-completion optional practical training (OPT). To qualify for the 24-month extension, you must: To apply for an extension, you must properly file: If you file your STEM OPT extension application on time and your OPT period expires while your extension application is pending, we will automatically extend your employment authorization for 180 days. This automatic 180-day extension ceases once USCIS adjudicates your STEM OPT extension application. F-1 students who have a pending STEM OPT extension application are not eligible for the temporary increase of the automatic extension period under the temporary final rule published on May 4, 2022. That temporary increase of the automatic extension period under 8 CFR 274a.13(d) only applies to the categories listed in the chart on the Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension page. Student Reporting Responsibilities If you receive a STEM OPT extension, you must: For more information, please refer to the DHS STEM OPT Hub. Unemployment during the OPT Period You may be unemployed during your OPT period for a limited number of days. If you are an employer who wants to provide a practical training opportunity to a STEM OPT student during their extension, you must: Terms and Conditions for Employer Participation To ensure the integrity of the program and provide safeguards for U.S. workers, any employer wishing to employ a student participating in the STEM OPT extension program must ensure that: DHS may, at its discretion, conduct a site visit of the employer to ensure that program requirements are being met, including that the employer possesses and maintains the ability, personnel, and resources to provide structured and guided work-based learning experiences consistent with the training plan. The Employer’s Training Obligation As noted above, to be eligible to employ a STEM OPT student, an employer must have and maintain a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student. The employer must attest to this fact by signing the Form I-983, Training Plan for STEM OPT Students. To establish a bona fide relationship, the employer may not be the student’s “employer” in name only, nor may the student work for the employer on a “volunteer” basis. Moreover, the employer that signs the Form I-983 must be the same entity that provides the practical training experience to the student. An employer must have sufficient resources and trained or supervisory personnel available to provide appropriate training in connection with the specified training opportunity at the location(s) where the student’s practical training experience will take place, as specified in the Form I-983. The “personnel” who may provide and supervise the training experience may be either employees of the employer, or contractors who the employer has directly retained to provide services to the employer; they may not, however, be employees or contractors of the employer’s clients or customers. Additionally, under no circumstances would another F-1 student with OPT or a STEM OPT extension (who is undergoing training in their own right) be qualified to train another F-1 student with a STEM OPT extension. While employers may rely on their existing training programs or policies to satisfy the requirements relating to performance evaluation and oversight and supervision, the student’s Training Plan must nevertheless be customized for the individual student. For instance, every Training Plan must describe the direct relationship between the STEM OPT opportunity and the student’s qualifying STEM degree, as well as the relationship between the STEM OPT opportunity and the student’s goals and objectives for work-based learning. Moreover, a STEM OPT employer may not assign, or otherwise delegate, its training responsibilities to a non-employer third party (e.g., a client/customer of the employer, employees of the client/customer, or contractors of the client/customer). As noted above, DHS, at its discretion, may conduct a site visit of any STEM OPT employer to ensure that the employer possesses and maintains the ability and resources to provide structured and guided work-based learning experiences consistent with the Form I-983. See 8 C.F.R. 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C)(11). Consistent with this provision, during a site visit, DHS may verify that the employer that signs the Form I-983 is the same entity that provides the practical training experience to the student and ensure compliance. For ICE to effectively conduct these site visits as part of its oversight responsibilities, it is important that employers report any change in a student’s employment address. As indicated above, the employer and student must report such a material change by submitting a modified Form I-983 to the DSO at the earliest available opportunity. The Employer’s Training Obligation: Staffing and Temporary Agencies Staffing and temporary agencies and consulting firms may seek to employ students under the STEM OPT program, but only if they will be the entity that provides the practical training experience to the student and they have and maintain a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student. STEM OPT participants may engage in a training experience that takes place at a site other than the employer’s principal place of business as long as all of the training obligations are met, including that the employer has and maintains a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student. Certain types of arrangements, including multiple employer arrangements, sole proprietorships, employment through ‘‘temp’’ agencies, employment through consulting firm arrangements that provide labor for hire, and other similar relationships may not be able to demonstrate a bona fide employer-employee relationship and, therefore, may not meet the requirements of the STEM OPT extension. As part of the STEM OPT extension, employers must complete the appropriate parts of Form I-983, Training Plan for STEM OPT Students. In this form, employers attest that: DHS will review on a case-by-case basis whether the student will be a bona fide employee of the employer signing the training plan, and verify that the employer that signs the training plan is the same entity that employs the student and provides the practical training experience.

       "\"Nonimmigrant Pathways for STEM Employment in the United States | USCIS\\n中文 (PDF, 357.48 KB) | 한국어 (PDF, 596.67 KB) | Русский (PDF, 540.72 KB) Nonimmigrant pathways offer opportunities to work in the United States for a specified length of time and for a range of reasons. They do not provide lawful permanent residence, although many people who come to the United States on nonimmigrant visas subsequently transition to permanent resident pathways, and eventually U.S. citizenship. The following nonimmigrant pathways also permit you to bring your spouse and children under the age of 21 with you to the United States. Generally, F-1 international students are not permitted to work in the United States. However, F-1 students may be eligible for Optional Practical Training (OPT). OPT permits an F-1 student to work in a position that is directly related to the student’s major area of study for up to 12 months. An F-1 student may be authorized for pre-completion OPT (before completion of the course of study) or post-completion OPT (after completion of the course of study). The time granted for post-completion OPT will be reduced by any time spent in pre-completion OPT. F-1 students who earned a degree in certain STEM fields are eligible for a 24-month extension of post-completion OPT, for a total of 36 months. This guide provides information for post-completion OPT, which is the most common type of OPT. Information about pre-completion OPT while working towards a degree is available on our Optional Practical Training (OPT) for F-1 Students page. Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify? You may be eligible for Optional Practical Training (OPT) if you are an F-1 student in the United States and you seek employment that is directly related to your major area of study. For the initial 12-month OPT: For the 24-month STEM OPT extension: Do I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me? You do not need to have a job offer before applying for the initial 12-month OPT. However, your proposed work must be directly related to your major area of study. Additionally, you cannot be unemployed for an aggregate of more than 90 days during any post-completion OPT period. For the 24-month STEM OPT period, you must be employed by an employer who is enrolled in and is using E-Verify and signs a Training Plan for STEM OPT Students (PDF) (Form I-983). For both initial OPT and the 24-month STEM OPT extension, you must submit the application directly to USCIS (Form I-765; more information here). An employer does not submit a petition for you. Will I be working in the United States on a permanent basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time? You will be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time. For the initial OPT period, you may be authorized up to a total of 12 months of full-time practical training at each educational level. (For example, you may have 12 months for a bachelor’s degree and another 12 months for a master’s degree). If you have a qualifying STEM degree, you may apply for a 24-month extension of your post-completion OPT. If you earn another qualifying STEM degree at a higher educational level than the first, you may be eligible for an additional 12-month OPT as well as another 24-month STEM OPT extension. For example, if you are in a valid period of up to 12 months of post-completion OPT, and you have a STEM degree, you can apply to extend your post-completion OPT by 24 months for a total OPT period of 36 months. If you earn another STEM degree at a higher level, you can again apply for up to 12 months of post-completion OPT followed by another 24 months of STEM OPT for another OPT total of 36 months at that educational level. A student may not be granted more than two STEM OPT extensions in that student’s lifetime. Are there any other criteria that are required for this specific pathway? F-1 students must first request a recommendation for OPT from the designated school official (DSO) at their U.S. college or university, which the DSO will note on the F-1 student’s Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status, in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). Only after securing a DSO endorsement on your Form I-20 and in SEVIS may you file the required Application for Employment Authorization (Form I-765) with USCIS. In addition, there are timing restrictions on when to duly file your Form I‑765 seeking either post-completion OPT or a 24-month STEM OPT extension. USCIS must receive any Form I-765 for post-completion OPT during the period that is no earlier than 90 days before you complete your degree and ending no later than 60 days after you complete your degree. In addition, your Form I-765 for post-completion OPT must be filed within 30 days after your DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record. For a 24-month STEM OPT extension, USCIS must receive the Form I-765 during the 90-day period prior to the expiration of your post-completion OPT and within 60 days after your DSO enters the recommendation for STEM OPT into your SEVIS record. F-1 students may not start working in the United States until receiving an employment authorization document (EAD). Working without an EAD can negatively affect your immigration status now and in the future. Further information You can find more information on the STEM OPT Hub and the Study in the States website from the Student and Exchange Visitor Program office of the Department of Homeland Security. The H-1B pathway enables people with at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) to work in a job that is related to their degree and that qualifies as a “specialty occupation.” There is an annual cap on the number of H-1B workers that can be granted initial H-1B status each year. There are some exceptions to the cap, mainly related to the nature of the U.S. employer. An H-1B worker is permitted to stay in the United States for a maximum of 6 years – but an H-1B worker could stay well beyond 6 years if that worker is on the path to obtaining lawful permanent resident status. Special note on the H-1B classification There is an annual cap on the number of H-1B workers that can be granted initial status each year. The H-1B classification has an annual cap of 85,000 for each fiscal year of the U.S. government (Oct. 1 to Sept. 30). That annual cap includes 20,000 status grants set aside solely for workers who have earned a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. institution of higher education. The demand for one of these “cap numbers” is generally extremely high. Therefore, USCIS operates an electronic registration process for employers (prospective petitioners) to register potential workers, and, unless demand for a cap number is unexpectedly low, those registrations are then included in a random selection process. This random selection process is typically conducted in late March or early April. Only those with selected registrations will be eligible to file H-1B cap-subject petitions, typically in early October. H-1B workers who are petitioned by or employed at an institution of higher education (or an affiliated or related nonprofit entity), a nonprofit research organization, or a government research organization are not subject to this numerical cap. Petitions that are not subject to the cap may be filed at any time during the year and do not require an electronic registration. Additionally, petitions for workers already in H-1B status and who are switching employers or applying for a renewal period are generally not subject to the cap. Nationals of Chile and Singapore may qualify for the H-1B1 classification, which has substantially the same requirements as the H-1B classification, but has its own separate cap. Similarly, nationals of Australia may qualify for the E-3 classification, which also has substantially the same requirements as the H-1B classification, but has its own separate cap. Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify? To qualify as an H-1B specialty occupation worker, you must meet the following requirements: What evidence can be submitted to help USCIS determine that my degree is related to the specialty occupation? Some of the evidence that is often submitted to demonstrate that your degree is related to the position in which you will be employed includes: Can I qualify if I do not have a bachelor’s degree? If you do not have at least a bachelor’s degree in a specialized field that is directly related to the position in which you will be employed, then you may qualify by: Note: Your sponsoring employer should submit equivalency documents for all foreign degrees. If work experience is considered, your sponsoring employer should submit an equivalency evaluation from an official who has authority to grant college-level credit. If the equivalency evaluation is not from the registrar, your sponsoring employer should submit a statement from the school’s registrar to establish that the particular evaluating official is authorized to grant college-level credit on behalf of his or her institution. Do I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me? You need to have a job offer and the position must qualify as a “specialty occupation.” In most instances, an employer will file a petition for you. Your prospective job must meet one of the following criteria: What evidence can be submitted to help USCIS determine that my position is in an occupation that requires a degree in a specialized field directly related to the position? You may reference the Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH) from the Department of Labor (DOL) to help determine whether certain jobs normally require at least a bachelor’s degree in a specialized field of study related to the occupation. If the OOH indicates that at least a bachelor’s degree in a specialized field is normally required for the occupation, the sponsoring employer should reference that OOH entry and submit an explanation as to how their position fits within that occupation. If the OOH does not indicate that at least a bachelor’s degree in a related, specialized field is normally required for the position, examples of evidence your sponsoring employer may submit to demonstrate that the position normally requires such a degree include: Will I be working in the United States on a permanent basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time? You will be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time. Initially, you may be granted up to 3 years to work in the United States (also known as the “validity period”). After your initial validity period, you may be granted extensions of up to 3 years. Generally, you are not eligible for any more extensions once you have been granted a total of 6 years. However, extensions beyond 6 years are permissible and not uncommon if an employer has taken certain steps in helping you apply for lawful permanent resident status (that is, you are the beneficiary of an approved I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker, for which an immigrant visa is not immediately available, or you are the beneficiary of a labor certification or I-140 petition that was filed at least 365 days before the requested H-1B petition start date). Are there any other criteria that are required for this specific pathway? Your sponsoring employer must submit a Labor Condition Application (LCA) for your position, certified by the Secretary of Labor, when filing the H-1B petition with USCIS. The LCA serves as proof that the employer is offering, and will offer during the period of authorized employment as an H-1B nonimmigrant, wages that are at least the actual wage level paid by the employer to all other individuals with similar experience and qualifications for the specific employment in question, or the prevailing wage level for the occupational classification in the area of employment, whichever is greater, based on the best information available as of the time of filing the LCA. The O-1A pathway allows nationally or internationally acclaimed talent across many fields the opportunity to work in the United States, and there is no annual numerical cap. There is no specified limit on the number of extensions a person can receive while working on an O-1. Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify? You may be eligible for an O-1A visa if you have “extraordinary ability” in the sciences, education, business, or athletics, which must be demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim and recognition. You must also be coming to the United States to continue work in your area of extraordinary ability (but the position does not have to require someone of such extraordinary ability). “Extraordinary ability” in the fields of science, education, business, or athletics means you have a level of expertise indicating you are one of the small percentage of people who have risen to the very top of your field. Requirement 1 - You must be able to establish that you have extraordinary ability in your field. To establish eligibility for an O-1A visa, the petitioner (your sponsoring employer or an agent) must either provide evidence that you have received a major, internationally recognized award, similar to a Nobel Prize, or (more commonly) must submit evidence that satisfies at least 3 of 8 evidentiary criteria. The USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance regarding how O-1A eligibility is evaluated, including a chart (reproduced below) that describes STEM-relevant examples of evidence that may satisfy each of the alternate O-1A evidentiary requirements, as well as considerations that are relevant to evaluating such evidence. Examples: Considerations: While many scholastic awards do not have the requisite level of recognition, there are some Ph.D. scholarships or dissertation awards, for example, that are nationally or internationally recognized as awards for excellence such that they may satisfy the requirements of this criterion. Relevant considerations include, but are not limited to: Examples: Considerations: The petitioner must show that membership in the association requires outstanding achievements in the field for which classification is sought, as judged by recognized national or international experts. Associations may have multiple levels of membership. The petitioner must show that in order to obtain the level of membership afforded to the beneficiary, the beneficiary was judged by recognized national or international experts as having attained outstanding achievements in the field for which classification is sought. As a possible example, membership in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) at the IEEE fellow level requires, in part, that a nominee have “accomplishments that have contributed importantly to the advancement or application of engineering, science and technology, bringing the realization of significant value to society,” and nominations are judged by an IEEE council of experts and a committee of current IEEE fellows.** As another possible example, membership as a fellow in the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) is based on recognition of a nominee’s “significant, sustained contributions” to the field of artificial intelligence, and is judged by a panel of current AAAI fellows.*** Relevant factors that may lead an officer to a conclusion that the person's membership in one or more associations was not based on outstanding achievements in the field include, but are not limited to, instances where the person's membership was based: Examples: Considerations: Published material that includes only a brief citation or passing reference to the beneficiary’s work is not “about” the beneficiary, relating to the beneficiary’s work in the field, as required under this criterion. However, the beneficiary and the beneficiary’s work need not be the only subject of the material; published material that covers a broader topic but includes a substantial discussion of the beneficiary’s work in the field and mentions the beneficiary in connection to the work may be considered material “about” the beneficiary relating to their work. Moreover, officers may consider material that focuses solely or primarily on work or research being undertaken by a team of which the beneficiary is a member, provided that the material mentions the beneficiary in connection with the work, or other evidence in the record documents the beneficiary’s significant role in the work or research. In evaluating whether a submitted publication is a professional publication, major trade publication, or major media, relevant factors include the intended audience (for professional and major trade publications) and the relative circulation, readership, or viewership (for major trade publications and other major media). Examples: Considerations: The petitioner must show that the beneficiary has not only been invited to judge the work of others, but also that the beneficiary actually participated in the judging of the work of others in the same or allied field of specialization. For example, a petitioner might document a beneficiary’s peer review work by submitting a copy of a request from a journal to the beneficiary to do the review, accompanied by evidence confirming that the beneficiary actually completed the review. Examples: Considerations: Analysis under this criterion focuses on whether the beneficiary’s original work constitutes major, significant contributions to the field. Evidence that the beneficiary’s work was funded, patented, or published, while potentially demonstrating the work’s originality, will not necessarily establish, on its own, that the work is of major significance to the field. However, published research that has provoked widespread commentary on its importance from others working in the field, and documentation that it has been highly cited relative to other works in that field, may be probative of the significance of the beneficiary’s contributions to the field of endeavor. Similarly, evidence that the beneficiary developed a patented technology that has attracted significant attention or commercialization may establish the significance of the beneficiary’s original contribution to the field. If a patent remains pending, USCIS will likely require additional supporting evidence to document the originality of the beneficiary’s contribution. Detailed letters from experts in the field explaining the nature and significance of the beneficiary’s contribution(s) may also provide valuable context for evaluating the claimed original contributions of major significance, particularly when the record includes documentation corroborating the claimed significance. Submitted letters should specifically describe the beneficiary’s contribution and its significance to the field and should also set forth the basis of the writer’s knowledge and expertise. Examples: Considerations: In order to meet this criterion, the beneficiary must be a listed author of the submitted article(s) but need not be the sole or first author. In addition, a petitioner need not provide evidence that the beneficiary’s published work has been cited to meet this criterion.***** In addition, the articles must be scholarly. In the academic arena, a scholarly article reports on original research, experimentation, or philosophical discourse. It is written by a researcher or expert in the field who is often affiliated with a college, university, or research institution and the article is normally peer-reviewed. In general, it should have footnotes, endnotes, or a bibliography, and may include graphs, charts, videos, or pictures as illustrations of the concepts expressed in the article. In non-academic arenas, a scholarly article should be written for learned persons in that field. In evaluating whether a submitted publication is a professional publication or major media, relevant factors include the intended audience (for professional journals) and the circulation or readership relative to other media in the field (for major media). Examples: Considerations: To show a critical role, the evidence should establish that the beneficiary has contributed in a way that is of significant importance to the organization or establishment’s activities. To show an essential role, the evidence should establish that the beneficiary’s role is (or was) integral to the entity. A leadership role in an organization often qualifies as critical or essential. For a supporting role to be considered critical or essential, USCIS considers other factors, such as whether the beneficiary’s performance in the role is (or was) integral or important to the organization or establishment’s goals or activities, especially in relation to others in similar positions within the organization. It is not the title of the beneficiary’s role, but rather the beneficiary’s duties and performance in the role that determines whether the role is (or was) critical or essential. Detailed letters from persons with personal knowledge of the significance of the beneficiary’s role can be particularly helpful in analyzing this criterion. The organization need not have directly employed the beneficiary. In addition, the organization or establishment must be recognized as having a distinguished reputation. Relevant factors for evaluating the reputation of an organization or establishment can include the scale of its customer base, longevity, or relevant media coverage. For academic departments, programs, and institutions, officers may also consider national rankings and receipt of government research grants as positive factors in some cases. For a startup business, officers may consider evidence that the business has received significant funding from government entities, venture capital funds, angel investors, or other such funders commensurate with funding rounds generally achieved for that startup’s stage and industry, as a positive factor regarding its distinguished reputation. Examples: Considerations: If the petitioner is claiming to meet this criterion, then the burden is on the petitioner to provide appropriate evidence establishing that the beneficiary’s compensation is high relative to others working in similar occupations in the field. The following webpages, among others, may be helpful in evaluating the relative compensation for a given field: Officers should evaluate persons working outside of the United States based on the wage statistics or comparable evidence for that locality, rather than by simply converting the salary to U.S. dollars and then viewing whether that salary would be considered high in the United States. * The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education recognizes R1 and R2 doctoral universities as having “very high” or “high” research activity, respectively, based on publicly available federal government data regarding the number of doctoral degrees awarded and the amount of total research expenditures. See the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education’s Basic Classification Description webpage. ** See the IEEE’s Steps to Become an IEEE Fellow webpage. *** See the AAAI Fellows Program webpage. **** While many articles accepted for presentation at conferences do not result in publication, there are conferences that peer review and publish accepted presentations in professional journals (sometimes called proceedings), such that they may qualify as scholarly articles under this criterion. *****Instead, officers may consider citation evidence relating to the published work as part of the totality analysis to evaluate whether the record establishes that the beneficiary has sustained national or international acclaim and is among the small percentage at the top of the field. For instance, documentation regarding the total rate of citations to the beneficiary’s body of published work relative to others in the field may indicate a beneficiary’s high overall standing for the purpose of demonstrating that the beneficiary is among the small percentage at the top of the field. ****** See SBIR America’s Seed Fund webpage. Note: If any of the criteria discussed above do not readily apply to your occupation, the petitioner may submit comparable evidence to establish your eligibility. When the required initial evidence has been provided, USCIS will evaluate the totality of the evidence to determine eligibility. The Policy Manual also includes guidance regarding the use of comparable evidence to establish eligibility, including use of comparable evidence by individuals in STEM fields, as well as the following guidance regarding how USCIS evaluates the totality of the evidence for O-1A petitions: When the evidentiary requirements specified above are satisfied, an officer proceeds to evaluate the totality of all the evidence in the record to determine whether the beneficiary has extraordinary ability with sustained national or international acclaim, as described in the O statute and regulations. At this step, officers may consider any potentially relevant evidence, even if such evidence does not fit one of the above regulatory criteria or was not presented as comparable evidence. The following are examples of situations where evidence might not directly correspond to the above regulatory criteria or might not be presented as comparable evidence, but would nonetheless be potentially relevant towards demonstrating, in the totality of the evidence, that an O-1A beneficiary is among the small percentage at the top of the field and that the beneficiary has sustained national or international acclaim:* In all cases, the petitioner has the burden of providing sufficient context regarding the above evidence and considerations to demonstrate that the evidence meets the relevant criteria and to establish the beneficiary’s extraordinary ability in the totality of the circumstances. * Not all cases will have such evidence, nor does a case need such evidence for the petitioner to demonstrate eligibility. Additionally, the list below is a non-exhaustive list of examples, and while the listed factors may be especially relevant to beneficiaries in STEM fields, the guidance applies to all O-1A petitions. ** Impact factor is commonly used as a measure of a journal’s influence; it represents the average number of citations received per article published in that journal during the 2 preceding years. See Garfield, E, The History and Meaning of the Journal Impact Factor, Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol. 295, Iss. 1, p. 90 (2006). *** The h-index is a tool for measuring a researcher’s output and impact. It is based on the highest number of the researcher’s publications that have been cited at least that same number of times. For example, if a researcher has an h-index of 10, it means the researcher has 10 publications that have 10 or more citations each (but not 11 publications with at least 11 citations each). See Hirsch, J, An Index to Quantify an Individual’s Scientific Research Output (PDF), Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 102, Iss. 46, p. 16569 (2005). **** This factor is less relevant for beneficiaries early in their career, as such persons have had less time to accumulate citations but may nevertheless have garnered acclaim and risen to the small percentage at the top of the field as demonstrated by other evidence in the record. As stated above, none of the listed factors are required to demonstrate eligibility. ***** The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education uses the R1 and R2 doctoral university designations to recognize institutions as having “very high” or “high” research activity, respectively, based on publicly available federal government data regarding the number of doctoral degrees awarded and the amount of total research expenditures. See the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education’s Basic Classification Description webpage. ****** The QS World University Rankings annually evaluate universities according to a methodology based on six consistent and empirical metrics: academic reputation (40%), employer reputation (10%), faculty to student ratio 20%), citations per faculty (20%), international faculty ratio (5%), and international student ratio (5%). These metrics are used to rank universities, as well as capture and assess university performance. See the QS World University Rankings Methodology webpage. Do I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me? You must be coming to the United States to continue work in your area of extraordinary ability. This is typically established by showing that you have a job offer with an employer in the United States. The petition must be filed by a U. S. employer, a U.S. agent, or a foreign employer through a U.S. agent. While the regulations prohibit an O-1A beneficiary from serving as the sponsoring employer for themselves, a separate legal entity (such as a corporation or limited liability company) that is partially or wholly owned by the beneficiary may file the petition on behalf of the O-1A owner. Will I be working in the United States on a permanent basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time? You will be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time. Initially, you may be granted up to 3 years to work in the United States (also known as the “validity period”). After your initial validity period, you may be granted extensions of up to 1 year. There is no specified limit to the number of extensions you can obtain. L-1 visas provide a pathway for employees of multinational companies who hold positions as managers/executives or have specialized knowledge, allowing them to work in the U.S. for a maximum of up to seven years. Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify? You may be eligible for an L-1 visa for “intracompany transferees” if you are an executive, manager, or a worker with specialized knowledge who has worked abroad for a qualifying organization (including an affiliate, parent, subsidiary or branch of your foreign employer) for at least 1 year within the 3 years preceding the filing of your L-1 petition (or in some cases your admission to the United States) in an executive or managerial capacity or in a position that requires specialized knowledge. USCIS divides L-1 visas into L-1A, for managers or executives, and L-1B, for workers possessing specialized knowledge. Have you been working abroad for at least one continuous year within the past 3 years? (Note: brief trips to the United States do not typically interrupt the continuous year. Also, time off work such as for a vacation, maternity leave, etc. do not typically interrupt the continuous year.) Some of the evidence typically submitted to document overseas employment for 1 out of the last 3 years includes: Was your overseas employment in a qualifying capacity? Some of the evidence typically submitted to demonstrate that overseas employment was in a managerial, or executive capacity includes: L-1A Manager or Executive L-1A managerial or executive positions may correlate with STEM occupations, depending on the individuals and work that is managed. There is no labor market test for an L-1 managerial or executive employee. Executive positions involve employees who make decisions with wide latitude, and who receive minimal oversight. Managerial positions include personnel managers and function managers and involve the supervision and control of professional employees’ work, or management of an organization or a part thereof. Some of the evidence that may be submitted to demonstrate that your overseas employment was in an executive or managerial capacity includes: L-1B Specialized Knowledge Worker L-1B specialized knowledge frequently overlaps with STEM occupations, as it involves “special knowledge of your employer’s product, service, research, equipment, techniques, management, or other interests and their application in international markets, or an advanced level of knowledge or expertise in your employer’s processes and procedures.” Some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate that your overseas employment was in a specialized knowledge capacity includes: Note: There is no requirement that an employee’s specialized knowledge be “unique” or “proprietary” in nature, but your knowledge must be “special” or of an “advanced” level. There is no labor market test for an L-1 specialized knowledge employee. USCIS has extensive guidance on the various means to demonstrate specialized knowledge, which are too extensive to be summarized here. Do I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me? You need to have a job offer and that position must be an executive or managerial position, as described above, or one that involves specialized knowledge. Also as noted above, the position must be with an entity that has a qualifying relationship with your foreign employer. The employer must file a petition for you. Does your company abroad have and will maintain a qualifying relationship (parent, subsidiary, affiliate, or branch) to the U.S. business that will employ you or that you will establish? The U.S. entity must have a qualifying relationship with the foreign entity abroad where you have been employed as a manager, executive, or worker with specialized knowledge. This means that the U.S. entity must be a parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or branch of the foreign entity, and that both the U.S. entity or office and a foreign entity must continue to have a qualifying relationship throughout the beneficiary’s stay in the United States. Some of the evidence typically submitted to show that a U.S. business has the requisite qualifying relationship to an overseas employer includes: Will I be working in the United States on a permanent basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time? You will be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time. Initially, you may be granted up to 3 years (1 year if you are setting up a new office) to work in the United States (also known as the “validity period”). After your initial validity period, you may be granted extensions of up to 2 years. You are not eligible for any more extensions once you have been granted a total of 7 years if you are an executive or a manager, or 5 years if you are a specialized knowledge worker. Can the L visas be used to expand an existing enterprise into the U.S.? One specific use of the L visa can be to open a new office in the United States that has a qualifying relationship with an existing overseas entity. The petition must demonstrate that the new office will support a managerial or executive position within 1 year. Specialized knowledge workers may also qualify for a new office petition. If approved, the validity period is 1 year. After that 1 year, the new office must submit an extension request by filing a new application or petition. If approved, that extension will be valid and subject to the same provisions as all other (non-new office) L petitions. Mexican and Canadian nationals can use the TN classification to work in the United States for professional purposes in qualifying professions (this list includes a number of STEM-related occupations). The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement (USMCA), which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), is the basis for the TN classification. The TN nonimmigrant classification permits qualified Canadian and Mexican citizens to seek temporary entry into the United States to engage in business activities at a professional level. There is no time limit on how long someone may be in TN status. Do I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify? The TN classification may be useful for STEM professionals such as engineers, pharmacists, and scientists. Not all professions qualify, but many of those that do are STEM-related. A full list of qualifying professions is included in the regulations. You may be eligible for TN nonimmigrant status, if: Do I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me? Will I be working in the United States on a permanent basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time? You will be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time. Initially, you may be granted up to 3 years to work in the United States (also known as the “validity period”). After your initial validity period, you may be granted extensions of up to 3 years. There is no specified limit to the number of extensions you can obtain. Are there any other criteria that are required for a specific pathway? The TN classification is only for Canadian or Mexican nationals. Nationals of other countries are not eligible nor are permanent residents of Canada or Mexico. More Information If you are a Canadian citizen, you are not required to apply for a TN visa at a U.S. Consulate, and may establish eligibility for TN classification by seeking admission to the United States at certain CBP-designated U.S. ports of entry or at a designated pre-clearance/pre-flight inspection station. You must provide the following documentation to the CBP officer: Please refer to CBP’s website for additional information and requirements for applying for admission to the United States. If a CBP officer finds you eligible for admission, you will be admitted as a TN nonimmigrant. Mexican citizens must apply for a TN visa directly at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in Mexico. See the U.S. Department of State webpage, Visas for Mexican and Canadian NAFTA Professional Workers. If you are a Mexican or Canadian citizen already in the United States, your employer may submit Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker to USCIS to either extend or change your status to TN. Premium processing service is available. The J-1 exchange visitor category is for nonimmigrants approved to participate in work and study-based exchange visitor programs. The J-1 program is administered by the Department of State (DOS). More information about the program is available at the DOS website. In January 2022, DOS announced measures to increase the flow of talent in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The Early Career STEM Research Initiative connects certain J-1 program sponsors with STEM-relevant sponsors, including businesses. Information on the education, experience, and skills required to qualify is available at the DOS website. USCIS.gov An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\""
